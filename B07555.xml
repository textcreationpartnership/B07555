            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE plat-forme of a Fortreſſe, by how much more it is planted vpon a ſure foundation, by ſo much more it is participant of a firme and forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perfection: which reaſon duly conſidered it ought to lead euery man ſo to rule himſelfe in all his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, as he may be both apt to receiue, and able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme all vertuous and valorous actions. Therefor he
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:181245:7"/> that deſires to become a Souldier of aſſured good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, to the intent he may be able to perſeuer in each en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, beare out euery brunt ſtoutly, and ſerue ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, he ought to haue a ſtrong body, ſound, free from ſickneſſe, and of a good complexion: So ſhall he be able to reſiſt the continuall toile and trauell, which of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie he muſt daily take, as continuall and extreame cold in the winter, immoderate heate in the ſummer, in march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the day, keeping ſentinell in the night, and in his cold cabben, in ſecret ambuſhes, and in trenches, where perchance he ſhall ſtand a number of houres in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and mire vp to the knees: and beſides vpon bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warkes, breaches in eſpialls, in ſentinels, perdues, and ſuch like, when occaſion requires and neceſſitie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraines: of all which exploites and diſcommodities hee muſt perforce be partaker.</p>
               <p>Wherefore that man which is not of ſuch ſufficiencie in body (to the end he ſpend not his time in vaine) it is very requiſite he reſolue himſelfe to exerciſe ſome other profeſſion, for although ſome doe hold that few men be ſtrong by nature, but many by exerciſe and induſtrie: yet that notwithſtanding ſtrength of body is firſt to be required, in reſpect that a Souldier muſt be aſwell ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, and as able to beare continuall trauell, as a bird can endure to flie, yea and to put on a reſolute minde, to beare all the miſeries and hazardes of warlike affaires. A Souldier is generally to be choſen betwixt 18. and 46. yeares.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, I ſuppoſe it moſt neceſſarie, that euery man according to the nature of his body, and inclined motion of his minde, make election of his armes and weapons, as of pike, halbert, or hargabuſe: Neuertheleſſe reſpect
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:181245:7"/> ought to be had to the proportion of his perſon, and to take ſuch armes as doth beſt agree with the ſame: to a tall man a pike, to a meane ſtature a halberd, and to a little nimble perſon a peece. But if he preferre his proper diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition before the qualitie of his perſon, it is very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie he exerciſe that weapon he makes choiſe of, to the intent he may attaine vnto a moſt perfect practiſe of the ſame, for as no man at the firſt time when he takes any toole or inſtrument in his hand, growes immediately at that inſtant to be a perfect artificer: euen ſo it is with a Souldier, vntill experience hath inſtructed him: touching which I meane to ſay ſomewhat.</p>
               <p>He which ſeekes to attaine and attribute to himſelfe the honourable name of a Souldier, muſt firſt employ his time in practiſe of thoſe armes wherewith he meanes to ſerue, and ſo apply his time, that when any enterpriſe ſhall call him forth to make proofe thereof, he may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to handle his peece with due dexterity, and his pike with an aſſured agilitie: ſince thoſe be the weapons wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with now <hi>Mars</hi> doth moſt commonly arme his warlike troupe, and trie each doubtfull fight of bloudy battaile: for in this our age experience and practiſe makes appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that Archers amongſt forreine Nations be neuer v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the halberd but either amongſt few or few in number. The Archer ſerues to ſmall purpoſe, but when he is ſhadowed with ſome trench or bulwarke free from hargabuſe or musket-ſhot: Or that lyning a band of Hargabuſiers, hee doth ſecond them in any inuading onſet, and then a whole flight of arrowes, ſo that they be light and able to flie aboue twelueſcore, will maruellouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gaule any maine battell of footemen or Squadron of Horſemen. The Halberd likewiſe doth onely ſerue in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:181245:8"/> the ſacke of a towne, in a breach, in a ſally, or canuiſado, to enter a houſe, or in the throng of a ſtroken battell to execute ſlaughter; wherefore touching theſe two wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, vnleſſe neceſſitie conſtraine, and that Hargabuſiers be wanting, Archers may well be ſpared: and theſe great numbers of Halberdiers and Bill-men, which are and haue beene in times paſt vſed in <hi>England,</hi> may well be left off, ſaue a few to guard euery Enſigne, and to attend vpon the Colonell, or Captaine, which in an armie will amount to a ſufficient number to depreſſe the ouercome and flying enemy.</p>
               <p>Therefore a Souldier muſt either accuſtome himſelfe to beare a peece or Pike: if he beare a peece, then muſt he firſt learne to hold the ſame, to accommodate his match betweene his two formoſt fingers and his thombe, and to plant the great end on his breaſt with a gallant Souldier-like grace: and being ignorant, to the intent he may bee more encouraged, let him acquaint himſelfe firſt with the firing of touch-pouder in his panne, and ſo by degrees both to ſhoote off, to bow and beare vp his body, and ſo conſequently to attaine to the leuell and practiſe of an aſſured and ſeruiceable ſhot, readily charge, and with a comely couch diſcharge, making choiſe at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of his marke with a quicke and vigilant eie.</p>
               <p>His flaske and touch-box muſt keepe his pouder, his purſe and mouth his bullets: in skirmiſh his left hand muſt hold his match and peece, and the right hand vſe the office of charging and diſcharging.</p>
               <p>Being againſt the enemie, whilſt with an indented courſe he doth trauell his plaine ground, or elſe takes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of his place and inuaſion, as vnder the ſafegard of a trench, the backe of a ditch, old-wall, tree or ſuch
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:181245:8"/> like: let him euer firſt load his peece with pouder out of his flaske, then with her bullet, and laſt with amuring, and touch-pouder, foreſeeing euer that the panne bee cleane, the couer cloſe, and the tutch-hole wide, or elſe well proind: ſo that ſtill obſeruing modeſt order in his trauerſe, neither ouerſlow, nor ouer-ſpeedy, to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent he become not each mans marke through his ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſhneſſe, nor runne himſelfe out of breath through his owne raſhneſſe, for the moſt part keeping his ſide to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his enemie: let him diſcharge going, but neuer ſtanding: ſo ſhall he the better ſhunne the enemies ſhot and chuſe his aſſured aduantage.</p>
               <p>A ſouldier ought to be carefull that his furniture bee good, ſubſtantiall and ſtaunch from raine, the charge of his flaske iuſt for his peece, and the ſpring quicke and ſharpe: The pipe of his touch-box ſomewhat wide, that the pouder may haue free paſſage, which otherwiſe would choake vp.</p>
               <p>In time of marching, and trauelling by the way let him keepe a paper in the panne and tutch-hole, and in wet weather haue a caſe for his peece ſomewhat portable, or elſe of neceſſitie he muſt keepe the ſame from wet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his arme-hole or caſſocke, or by ſome other inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on free from damage of the weather, and his match in his pocket, onely that except which he burnes: and that like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſo cloſe in the hollow of his hand, or ſome artificiall pipe of pewter hanging at his girdle, as the coale by wet or water go not out.</p>
               <p>It is moreouer requiſite, that a ſouldier keepe his cocke with oyle free in falling, and his peece bright without ruſting, neither muſt he want his neceſſarie tooles, as a ſcowrer, tirebale and worme, hauing euery one a vice to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:181245:9"/> turne into the end of the ſcouring ſticke, ſo that if through wet weather or any other accident, his peece will not be diſcharged, the skilfull Souldier may with his tireball pull out his bullet, with the worme, the paper and wet pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and with his ſcourer make his peece cleane within: His ſcourer muſt be trimmed on the end with a linnen-cloth of a ſufficient ſubſtance, therewith to make cleane the cannon of his peece within. The one end of his ſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſticke ought to haue a round end of bone of iuſt big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with the mouth of his peece, therewithall at his pleaſure to ramme in pouder and paper, or in ſteed of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ſuch ſoft haire as they ſtuffe ſaddles withall, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger whereof is not like: but this the Souldier muſt vſe when time permits. During the time of his ſeruice let him euer haue a diligent care to keepe his peece cleane and bright within, and once a fortnight, or at the leaſt once a month take out the breech and throroughly view and waſh the barrell within, to ſee whether it hath any flawes, brackes, chambers, frettings, or ruptures, which would endanger the breaking thereof, eſpecially if before hand the end of his bare ſcourer haue giuen him any cauſe to ſuſpect ſuch faults, to the intent he may change the ſame for a new for feare of ſpoiling himſelfe.</p>
               <p>He that loues the ſaftie of his owne perſon, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in the goodneſſe and beauty of a peece, let him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies make choiſe of one that is double breeched, and if it be poſſible a myllan peece, for they be of a tough and perfect temper, light, ſquare, and bigge of breech, and very ſtrong where the pouder doth lie, and where the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent force of the fire doth conſiſt, and notwithſtanding thinne at the end.</p>
               <p>Our Engliſh peeces approach very neere vnto them
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:181245:9"/> in goodneſſe and beautie (their heauineſſe only excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) ſo that they be made of purpoſe, and not one of theſe common ſale peeces with round barrells, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a beaten ſouldier will haue great reſpect, and chooſe rather to pay double money for a good peece, then to ſpare his purſe and endanger himſelfe.</p>
               <p>But to returne to my matter, let a ſouldier haue hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing euer at the ſtrings of his tutch-box, or ſome other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die part of his garment, a couple of proyning pinnes at the leaſt, that if by fortune the tutch-hole of his peece be ſtopped or furred vp, hee may therewith both make his pan cleane, and yeeld a ready paſſage that the fire may haue her courſe, by incorporating both the tutch-pouder without, and the corne-pouder within together. But a ready Souldier will alwaies fore-ſee that the tutch hole be ſo wide, as the pouder without in the pan may haue free concourſe to that within the peece, thereby to haſten more ſpeedy diſcharge, conſidering a ſouldier cannot haue leaſure and commoditie to proine his peece at all times, but muſt of neceſſitie vſe a great dexterity.</p>
               <p>But ſince I am falne into the ſpeech of a quicke charge, and nimble diſcharge, I will by the way declare the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of certaine nations therein.</p>
               <p>Experience of late daies hath taught vs, that thoſe Nations which follow the warres, inuent euery way how they may endomage the enemie in all their enterpriſes, but eſpecially in skirmiſh, which for the moſt part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in ſhot, and by ſuch as can with the eye of his minde make an aſſured leuell, and with a nimble diſcharge, both chooſe out and kill his enemie.</p>
               <p>And therefore thoſe ſouldiers which in our time haue beene for the moſt part leuied in the Low-countries,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:181245:10"/> eſpecially, thoſe of <hi>Artoyes</hi> and <hi>Henault,</hi> called by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall name of <hi>Wallownes</hi> haue vſed to hang about their neckes, vpon a baudricke or border, or at their girdles certaine pipes which they call charges, of copper and tin made with couers, which they thinke in skirmiſh to bee the moſt readie way. But the <hi>Spaniard</hi> diſpiſing that order, doth altogether vſe his flaske.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French-man,</hi> both charge and flaske. But ſome of our <hi>Engliſh-nation,</hi> their pocket, which in reſpect of the danger of the ſparkes of their match, the vncertaine charge, the expence and ſpoile of pouder, the diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie of wet, I account more apt for the ſhow of a triumph and wanton skirmiſh before Ladies and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, then fit for the field, in a day of ſeruice in the face of the enemy: and in like ſort the charge which either doth ſhed and looſe his pouder whilſt a Souldier doth trauerſe his ground, or elſe is ſo cloddered and rammed together, that he ſhall be forced ſometimes to faile of halfe his charge. Therefore I conclude with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> that a good flaske is that which is moſt warlike and ready in ſeruice without the curious helpe of any extraordinary inuention.</p>
               <p>One of the greateſt helpes conſiſts in pouder and match: for a Souldier muſt euer buy his pouder ſharpe in taſte, well incorporate with ſalt-peter, and not full of coole-duſt. Let him accuſtome to drie his pouder if hee can in the ſunne, firſt ſprinkled ouer with <hi>Aqua-vitae</hi> or ſtrong Claret-wine &amp;c. Let him make his tutch-pouder, being finely ſarſed and ſifted, with quick-pale, which is to be bought at the Pouder-makers or Apothecaries: and let his match be ſo boiled in aſhes, lye and pouder, that it will both burne well, carrie a long coale, and that will
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:181245:10"/> not breake off with the touch of your finger. The prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations will at the firſt touch giue fire, and procure a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, ſpeedy, and thundering diſcharge. Some vſe brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone finely poudered in their tutch-pouder, but that furs and ſtops vp your breech and tutch-hole.</p>
               <p>The bullet of a ſouldiers peece muſt be of a iuſt big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with the mouth of the ſame, ſo that falling in ſmoothly, it may driue downe, and cloſe vp the mouth of the pouder. Some contrary to the lawes of the field vſe chaine-ſhot, and quarter-ſhot, which is good in the defence of a breach, to keepe a fortreſſe, or vpon ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board: but being daily vſed, it will gaule a peece within, and put it in hazard to breake, ſpecially in a long skirmiſh when the barrell is hot.</p>
               <p>Note that after his peece is very hoate, let the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier if he can, giue ſomewhat a leſſe charge for feare of burſting his peece, vnleſſe he haue good triall thereof. If the ſtocke of his peece be crooked, he ought to place the end iuſt before aboue his left pappe: if long and ſtraight, as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> vſe them, then vpon the point of his right ſhoulder, vſing a ſtately vpright pace in diſcharge.</p>
               <p>It is not in vaine to aduertiſe him, that in skirmiſh hee muſt hold his peece betwixt his thombe and the ends of his fingers, which I account a ſure meane, betwixt gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the barrell, and laying the ſame onely vpon his foremoſt finger and thombe, for the one is ouer dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and the other altogether vnſteedy.</p>
               <p>I iudge it likewiſe moſt conuenient for him, to take hold of his peece with his left hand in that part of the wood (wherein the barrell lies) there as the peece is of moſt equall ballance. Although ſome accuſtome them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to hold it iuſt vnder the cocke, by reaſon whereof
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:181245:11"/> he ſhall be enforced to change his hand if he charge out of a flaske, into the midſt of the peece, to bring downe the mouth to his flaske which is great delay and hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in skirmiſh. So to conclude, he that meanes to be accompted a forward and perfect good ſhot, by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all exerciſe muſt be ſo ready, that in all particular points touching his peece, pouder, match, bullets, and the vſe of them, that he neither be to ſeeke, nor grow amazed in the furious rage of <hi>Bellonas</hi> fiery skirmiſhes, her ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine ſurpriſes, and bloody ſlaughter of dangerous aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults of cruell battailes.</p>
               <p>The Musket is to be vſed in all reſpects like vnto the Hargabuſe, ſaue that in reſpect he carries a double bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, and is much more weightie. He vſeth a ſtaffe breaſt-high, in the one end a pike to pitch in the ground, and in the other an iron forke to reſt his peece vpon, and a hoale a little beneath the ſame in the ſtaffe: whereunto he doth adde a ſtring, which tied and wrapped about his wreſt, yeelds him commodity to traine his forke or ſtaffe after him whilſt he in skirmiſh doth charge his Musket afreſh with pouder and bullet.</p>
               <p>Now to ſpeake ſomewhat of a Pike-mans charge, a few words ſhall ſuffice, becauſe I will not be ouer-tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Let him learne to toſſe his pike, couch and croſſe the ſame, to receiue the violent charge of Horſe-men, to front the furious ſhocke of foote-men, and be able to furniſh out his fight both a farre-off and neere hand: Which Notes with the like will be ſufficient, by reaſon that he is for the moſt part put to ſtand in a maine and ſquare-battaile. Both the Hargabuſier and Pike-man muſt weare a ſhort rapier and a ſmall poinado: for if in the middeſt of Encounters and Skirmiſhes, they be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:181245:11"/> to vſe them, their length is an occaſion they cannot be drawne, vnleſſe he abandon his peece or pike, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ſhall either looſe his pike, or want his rapier, which at the Sera and cloſe is very neceſſarie both for defence and offence: contrary to the careleſſe cuſtome of ſome, whom I haue ſeene come into the field without rapier or dagger, which was an aſſured argument, that their heeles ſhould be their target, and their ſhamefull flight their ſafety, when their pouder was ſpent.</p>
               <p>Now as theſe careleſſe perſons farre miſſe the marke with ouer great ſecuritie, ſo ſome bring in a cuſtome of too much curioſitie in arming Hargabuſiers, for beſides a peece, flaske, tutch-box, rapier and dagger: they loade them with a heauie ſhirt of male, and a Burganet: ſo that by that time they haue marched in the heat of the ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer or deepe of the winter ten or twelue Engliſh-miles, they are more apt to reſt, then ready to fight, whereby it comes to paſſe that either the enterpriſe they go about, which requires celerity, ſhall become fruſtrate by reaſon of the ſtay they make in refreſhing themſelues, or elſe they are in danger to be repulſed for want of luſtineſſe, breath, and agilitie.</p>
               <p>Wherefore in mine opinion it is not neceſſarie, that this extraordinarie arming of ſhot ſhould be vſed, but in ſurpriſes of Townes, Eſcalades, and aſſaults of breaches, to defend the Souldiers heads from ſtones, and ſuch ſtuffe as they beſieged haue prepared to driue them from their enterpriſe: Or elſe in ſome ſpeciall ſet battaile againſt the cut and thruſt of weapons: which exploits, for that they be not ſo ordinary as is the skirmiſh, ſo are theſe armes nothing ſo neceſſarie, but rather a burthen more beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then beneficiall, and of greater charge then commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:181245:12"/> ſpecially a ſhirt of male, which is very dangerous, for ſhot, if a number of thoſe ſmall peeces ſhould bee driuen into a mans body by a bullet.</p>
               <p>The furniture due to a Pike-man beſides his pike, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier and dagger, conſiſting of a common corſelet, hauing a coller, curiat, taſes, back-part, poldrowes, wambraſſes, and burganets for the head, for that they be ſufficiently knowne, becauſe I will not be ouer prolixe vpon euery particular point, I will onely ſay thus much more touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pike-man, that he ought to haue his pike at the point and middeſt trimmed with handſome taſſels, and a handle, not ſo much for ornament as to defend the Souldiers body from water, which in raine doth runne downe alongſt the wood.</p>
               <p>Euery Souldier ought to carry his Hargabuſe, Pike or Halberd, vpon that ſhoulder and ſide, which is outward in ranke, for that ſide which is diſcouered inward is more defended by the generall order that is kept, then any of the other. Which order of carrying armes, is not onely ready and commodious to vſe at all occaſions, but alſo doth make a gallant ſhew, and a generall forme of good proportion, and true proſpect: a thing moſt neceſſarie for a man of valour to vſe in all his doings.</p>
               <p>He ought likewiſe euer to haue good regard to weare his weapon of like length the other Souldiers vſe, which in marching doth make the rankes to be of one iuſt line, and in ſhew of a ſeemely and ſtreight proportion, cauſing the whole band to carry a braue and ſingular grace.</p>
               <p>A Souldier ought euer to retaine and keepe his armes in ſaftie and forth comming, for he is more to be deteſted then a Coward, that will looſe or play away any part thereof, or refuſe it for his eaſe, or to auoide paines:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:181245:12"/> Wherefore ſuch a one is to be diſmiſſed with puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or made ſome abiect Pioner. Therefore during his ſeruice and after his returne home, let him ſtill bee wedded to his weapons and armour, that when he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vpon againe to ſerue his Prince, he be not enforced to furniſh himſelfe againe with new Armes, ſometimes old, of little value, and leſſe goodneſſe: as ſome ſouldiers now adaies to their great diſcommendation doe vſe. A cuſtome altogether different from the true exerciſe of armes, and varying from the rule of other warlike-nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which make true profeſſion of armes: amongſt the which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Zuitzers</hi> at this day are to bee commended; the one for obſeruing an apt, ſumptuous, and warlike choiſe therein, and the other for that they beare all ſorts of armes with great aduantage, both in length and ſtrength, the which vnto them becomes very familiar through the abilitie of body they poſſeſſe.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Souldiers which cannot endure the toile and trauell to beare armes of defence, namely the Pikeman and Halberdier are made ſubiect to receiue both blowes and death by the hands of their enemies, or through their diſaduantage to take a ſhamefull flight, or at the firſt encounter to remaine their priſoners.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is very neceſſarie for a Souldier to take paines in daily practiſe, &amp; to acquaint himſelfe through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the exerciſe and carriage of armes, whereof hee ought to vſe practiſe, ſpecially of thoſe that be offenſiue, and in thoſe which ordinarily we are accuſtomed to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as the Rapier, and Dagger, Pike, and Halberd and ſuch like, without making open and apparent profeſſion of the practiſe thereof, but ſecret and ſeuerall from the wide ſight of the world, that afterwards he may put the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:181245:13"/> ſame in practiſe to his greater aduantage and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>
               <p>Finally the Halberdier, who is armed either with bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gandine or corſlet, ought of duty to attend with his hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berd when his turne comes about his Enſigne, in march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſet ſquares, in the Captaines lodging and tent for his guard, and at the entrance of a houſe &amp;c. to be the foremoſt perſon to force the paſſage.</p>
               <p>But in a day of battaile the old <hi>Romane</hi> ſhield and a ſhort ſharpe-pointed ſword, to execute in a throng of men, exceedes the Halberd and browne-bill.</p>
               <p>Beſides the Pikeman which is armed all ouer with a corſlet, and is to performe his duty in a maine ſquare, ſtand, or battaile, to receiue the ſhocke of horſemen, or charge of the enemies infantery;</p>
               <p>There be yet another ſort of light-armed Pikes, which onely haue the fore-part of a corſlet, and a head-peece, as is the <hi>Almaine</hi> riuet, or good light-iacke, or plate-coate: theſe ſometimes may be ſent amongſt the forlorne-hope of Hargabuſiers, to defend them from the inuaſions of Horſe-men.</p>
               <p>But touching ſhot, I would wiſh our Nation, being men of ſtrong conſtitution of body, to beare a Peece be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the boare of a Caliuer and a Musket, the which with ſmall vſe they would be able to weeld very well at the armes end; which would cary a great aduantage in skirmiſh: the which like vnto the Hargabuſe, they might (as I ſaid before) exerciſe, and with a gallant and aſſured raiſing-vp the crooked end of the ſtocke, to his breaſt, hauing before-hand fitted the coale of his match to giue quicke and iuſt fire, whereof euer he muſt take the certaine meaſure, muſt then diſcharge amidſt his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:181245:13"/> trauerſe, to his greateſt aduantage, and to endomage his enemies: Which done he muſt firſt fold-vp againe the falne match in a ready and conuenient ſort betwixt his fingers, hauing both the ends of his match light at once, that whilſt the one is ſpent, and in kindling againe, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may ſerue his turne.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe foreſaid weapons I would not thinke it inconuenient, to haue in a Band certain targets of proofe to march in the front, which were very neceſſarie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend a ranke of men in a ſtreight-lane, paſſage, breach or other place from the enemies ſhot, they all cloſely and in a low order marching vnder the fauour and ſhade of them: as in a skirmiſh I ſaw put in practiſe, when <hi>Caſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire</hi> did march with the STATES armie vnder <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaine,</hi> 1578.</p>
               <p>The Captaine is to ſet downe by the Generals appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ſumme of all their paies, and the difference therein, according to euery mans weapon and qualitie. But to ſpeake of other directions and militarie obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</p>
               <p>A foot-man that is a Souldier, ought aboue all things to be obedient to his Captaine and officers, and neuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon his Enſigne, nor be abſent from his companie without leaue or ſpeciall let. In his march hee ought to be modeſt, ready in his ranke, obſerue a long diſtance in his Laumband, and keepe an equall ſtay in his Alta.</p>
               <p>If words of aduertiſement doe paſſe ouer from ranke to ranke alongſt the marching band, let him deliuer thoſe words plainely and with diligence, which the Captaine giues ouer to be pronounced from mouth to mouth, as to paſſe Parole appertaines.</p>
               <p>If the enemie cauſe ſodaine Arme, let his bale en bouche
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:181245:14"/> and his match in the cocke ſhew his ready good-will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to receiue repulſe, or giue charge.</p>
               <p>If either for pleaſure in a muſter, or in any other ſhew in ſport or earneſt, his Company be commanded to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge certaine volies of ſhot, or a Salua, he muſt either hold his peece ſidelong the rankes, whilſt he doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the ſame, or with the end higher then their heades, and diſcharge ouer the toppes of the formoſt rankes, for feare of hurting his Companions: which rule they ought to obſerue, and thereunto be conſtrained, vpon paine of ſeuere puniſhment.</p>
               <p>If any enterpriſe be made in the night, let him not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly keepe his match cloſe from open ſhew, or falling ſparkes, but be vigilant and keepe ſilence, to the intent that through his negligence and noiſe their actions be not diſcouered.</p>
               <p>If he keepe Sentinell, and haue the watch-word, let him giue eare diligently to all rumours, noiſes, and view warily all ſuſpected places, to the intent if he heare any trampling, neying of horſes, or approaching enemie (which he may the more eaſily heare by making a hole in the ground, and laying his eare to the ſame) or that he doth ſee the twinkling light of matches, or perceiue any other preſumption of the enemie, hee may either by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging his peece, and crying Saint <hi>George,</hi> arme, arme, giue warning to the next Corpes of guard, that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie doth approach, or elſe if his ſuddaine inuaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire not preſent aduertiſement, he may deferre the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port thereof vntill the comming of the next round, vnto whom he muſt from point to point declare what he hath ſeene and heard.</p>
               <p>During the time of his Sentinell, hee ought to keepe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:181245:14"/> himſelfe very cloſe, wakefull, ſecret, and without noiſe or rumour, his match cloſe and ſure from ſeeing, and his peece ready charged, loaden with her bullet, and proind with tutch-pouder.</p>
               <p>If the Round or any other Officer come to ſearch to watch and Sentinels, when he doth firſt heare or ſee them approach, let him ſo ſoone as he doth perceiue them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund with a loud voice, <hi>Qui va la?</hi> Who goes there? to which when anſwere is made, Friends, and that they draw neerer, then let him call to them and commaund that all the whole troupe, but onely one with the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word, to make preſent ſtay, vntill the word be giuen. And if at the ſame inſtant another Round ſhould come another way, let him cauſe the one of them to pauſe and abide ſtill, vntill he haue receiued the word of the other, that thereby he may auoide the inuironing ſnares of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine or priuie enemies, which might by that meanes ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe him.</p>
               <p>Therefore in this reſpect let him take great care, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially before a Towne beſieged, or about the circuit of a Campe, and that he alwaies remember to receiue him that giues the word at the end of his peece or pike, and out of danger, hauing his match ready in his Cocke, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to giue fire, thereby to reward him with a bullet as an enemie, if he giue a wrong word, or entertaine him as a friend if he giue the right: for vnder colour of giuing the word, many Sentinels haue loſt their liues, and ſuddaine ſurpriſes and canuiſados haue beene giuen.</p>
               <p>If in the night Arme be giuen in the Campe, he muſt make repaire immediately with his peece and furniture to his Enſigne, where he ſhall be employed as occaſion doth offer.</p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:181245:15"/>
               <p>That he may be the more ready at any ſuddaine Arme, lying in a towne in Garriſon, and being furried and lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a houſe, he ought to haue all the night burning in his chamber by him a candle or lampe, or at the leaſt his fire ſo well raked vp as he may light a candle at the coales with a match of brimſtone, or otherwiſe: that thereby hee may the more ſpeedily not onely finde his armes (which of purpoſe he ought to lay readily in an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie place) but alſo be better able to prepare himſelfe, and kindle his match with all ſpeede.</p>
               <p>Note that a Souldier in Garriſon being furried in a houſe, is allowed the beſt bed and chamber ſaue one, faire ſheetes, board-clothes, plates, napkins, towels, dreſſing of his meate, ſeruice at the table, oile, vineger, ſalt, muſtard, candle-light, fire, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Whileſt a Souldier is in the Campe, he ought neuer to lie out-of his clothes, his peece ready charged muſt lye by his ſide, his furniture at his girdle, which is his flaske, match and tutch-boxe, his rapier very ready, and his poinado likewiſe at his girdle, which if they ſhould be ſo monſtrous daggers, or ſuch a Cutlers ſhoppe as our Engliſh Fencers are accuſtomed to weare, they would be both combrous in cariage, and troubleſome to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, and to himſelfe, eſpecially when they lye in their Cabbins.</p>
               <p>A Souldier in Campe muſt make choiſe of two or three or more Camerades, ſuch as for experience, fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and conditions, doe beſt agree with his nature, that be tried Souldiers and truſtie friends, to the intent that like louing brethren, they may ſupport one another in all aduerſe fortune, and ſupply each others wants. As for example, hauing marched all day, and comming at night
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:181245:15"/> to the place where they muſt encampe, one of them chooſeth out the drieſt and warmeſt plot of ground he can get in the quarter, which is appointed to his band for lodging place, doth keepe all their Clokes, Armes, and Baggage, whileſt another makes prouiſion with one of their boies, in ſome adioyning village (if time and ſafety from the enemie doth permit) for long ſtraw, both to couer their cabbin, and make their bed of: during the time that an other with a little hatchet (which with a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bottle for drinke, a little kettle to ſeeth meate in, and a bagge of ſalt, which are to be borne of the boyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other Baggage, and are moſt neceſſarie things for encamping) doth cut downe forked bowes and long poales to frame and reare vp their cabbin withall, and prouide timber, or firewood, if it be in winter, or when need requires, whilſt another doth viſite vniandiers and victualers (if any follow the campe) for bread, drinke, and other cates, if otherwiſe they be not prouided by forrage or picoree, and makes a hole in the earth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hauing made a fire, ſtroken two forked ſtakes at either ſide, and hanged his kettle to ſeath vpon a cudgell of wood vpon the ſame, or that for roſt-meate hee makes a ſpit, wodden gauberds, &amp;c. And whilſt thus euery one is occupied about their neceſſarie occaſions at one inſtant, they may in due time make prouiſion for all their wants, and by meanes of this league of amitie amongſt them, enioy a ſufficient time to reſt their wearied bodies, which otherwiſe would be hard to be done.</p>
               <p>Therefore I iudge it very requiſite that the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber vnder the charge of a Deſnier or cheife of a chamber, ſhould linke themſelues together in perfect friendſhippe, and aſwell in skirmiſh and fight aide one another, as in all
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:181245:16"/> other actions, by which inuincible knot they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue wonderfull commoditie.</p>
               <p>It imports much that a Souldier ſhould be tractable, for a man cannot imagine a thing either more ingenuous or better, then due and conuenient ciuility. Therefore let him accuſtome himſelfe rather to be of a Saturnine and ſeuere condition then a common Skoffer, and an ordinarie make-ſport, that he may continue in friendſhip with his companions, and continually remaine in their amitie.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, he is much to be commended, which aptly with facilitie and great dexterity can be conuerſant with euery one: wherein if a man doe not with great iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment very circumſpectly gouerne himſelfe, hee ſhall for the moſt part incurre the euill will of thoſe in whoſe companie hee remaines. The which dealing is of great importance, aſwell for the intereſt of his life, and proper honour and credite, by which meanes the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth hang in ballance, as alſo for that he cannot, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawne away with debates, apply himſelfe diligently to follow the warres and ſeruice of his Captaine: the which ought to be his chiefeſt obiect and end. For diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord amongſt men of this Honourable profeſſion, doth haſten, and occaſion very much the deſtruction of their well doing; and altogether hinder whatſoeuer they take in hand, by reaſon of the ſuſpicions, diſcordes, deſpite, and other reſpects which of neceſſitie are commonly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to grow and enſue.</p>
               <p>Beſides, he muſt be ſo moderate in ſpending his wages, that he be not conſtrained before the midſt of his pay, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to follow the ſpoile, or borrow of others: whereof ſpringeth a naughtie reputation and a great diſcredit: yet
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:181245:16"/> notwithſtanding he muſt not ſuffer himſelfe to be noted for a couetous perſon, or as ſome ſay, the enemie of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: that is, by ſparing nigardly, to finde a great want and extremitie in neceſſarie things appertaining to his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell and victuals, whoſe expences ought cheifly to be in galant Armor and furniture.</p>
               <p>Note that the pay and wages which he receiues of his Captaine and Treaſurer, muſt not be taken or thought to ſerue or ſupply for any other vſe, but to ſuſtaine life with victuals, keepe him apparelled, and maintaine his armes. Therefore ought it to be gouerned diſcreetly and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at all times, in what place ſoeuer he ſhall remaine, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the campe, ciuill cities, or in his proper houſe, as well to keepe himſelfe in health, as cheifly to make appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to his Captaine the noble motion of his minde: So that pricked forward by this ſpurre of honour, and not for any other extraordinarie and baſe occaſion, a good ſouldier is continually conſtrained to win credite, deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all other dealing which ariſeth from hope of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity and greedy gaine, the way to make a man eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to carrie a baſe minde, and almoſt not diſagreeing from brute breaſts without reaſon. For theſe priuate Souldiers which ſeeke by ſuch meanes as be extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, to aduance themſelues aboue their proper pay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt giue an euill preſage of themſelues, and ſo euill that it ſhould be better for them to apply their time in ſome other ſort, as about merchandiſe and other occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations, rather then follow the honourable exerciſe of Armes, which is altogether grounded vpon a noble minde, valiant courage, and extreame trauell of body.</p>
               <p>He muſt diſpoſe himſelfe to be very diligent in what exerciſe or enterpriſe ſoeuer he ſhall be put vnto, as to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:181245:17"/> make Sentinell: wherein it is conuenient, as I haue touched before, that he be very vigilant when it is his lot to be commanded thereunto, that in doing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, there ſucceed not a moſt rigorous chaſtiſement by leauing his body dead behind him, as it may very well fall out, and to whom it may be ſaid, I left him as I found him, ſince ſleepe is the image of death.</p>
               <p>A good Souldier ought continually to accompany the Enſigne, and haue ſpeciall regard, that the ſame fall not in danger of ſurpriſing by the enemie, and that he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour himſelfe by all meanes without any reſpect of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to preſerue and recouer the ſame: for the loſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is a perpetuall ſhame to the whole band. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ought at no time to abandon the ſame for any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, but lodge himſelfe ſo neere it as he can, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that amongſt the reſt, if it be poſſible, he may be one of the firſt at all rumours of armes, and ſodaine alarums, aſwell by day as night. And being armed with the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon he caries, hauing conducted his Enſigne to the place appointed, by the head Officers, he may in the ſight of his Captaine (ſhewing a moderate forwardneſſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire) breed an opinion of his courage and valor: ſo that when occaſion doth offer, his Captaine amongſt the reſt may make ſpeciall choiſe of him.</p>
               <p>He muſt for no occaſion abſent himſelfe, or go to any far diſtant place about any enterpriſe or booty of picoree, without the expreſſe licence of his Captaine: for he that is once become a Souldier is now no more his own man, but his vnder whoſe gouernment he is paide: who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to ſerue his turne when occaſions be miniſtred in time of warres, not hauing his valiant and beſt Souldiers preſent and ready about him, ſhall not onely be made
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:181245:17"/> fruſtrate of that he would performe, but ſometimes alſo ſuffer and ſuſtaine damage, and onely in reſpect of thoſe which be abſent abroad at their owne pleaſure, contrary to the conſent and knowledge of the Captaine.</p>
               <p>He ought ſufficiently to eate, reſt and ſleepe, whileſt time doth permit, to the end he be not called for vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, and that he may the more readily performe all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes needfull, without any diſcommodity or want of abilitie, which commonly doe fall out vnlooked for, and vpon the ſodaine, for in ordinary and accuſtomed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes, it is an eaſie thing to finde euery ſouldier proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but in ſodaine ſurpriſes not. Beſides, I thinke it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaines and is proper to a good Souldier, to follow the warres ſo long as he poſſibly can, for the increaſe of his experience. But being conſtrained to returne into his Countrey, or into any Citie, fortreſſe or other place of defence, by reaſon of ſome truce, ſeconded by peace, or through any other accident, which doth conſtraine him to abandon the warres: then it is neceſſary he fall to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe that Art, wherein he chiefly hath been brought vp, either in merchandiſe, handicraft, or huſbandrie, or elſe whatſoeuer, thereby to ſupply his neceſſities, to exerciſe his body, and to liue honeſtly: and by that meanes flie idleneſſe, a thing moſt incident to youth: who being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ignorant in treading the ſteppes of a ſtaied life (through the ſmall experience hee hath of the world, which by tract of time is obtained, and by long practiſe, ſpecially in the exerciſe of armes) perſwades himſelfe he ſhall winne credit and commodity through the meanes of inſolent actions, which altogether ought to be abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: through raſh and prodigall brauerie, which often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times torments innocent Families and poore Parents:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:181245:18"/> and through galant garments and ſumptuous attire, whereby they grow Bankerout: ſo that they are brought in time (being intangled in thoſe ſweete traps ſaueſt and ſharpe ſhowers) to runne headlong into a thouſand and moſt miſerable ruines. Therefore good Souldiers ought ſpecially to endeauour themſelues by ſome commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble induſtrie to gaine the good grace of valorous and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Captaines, and mightie Princes, the true Poſſeſſors and fathers of warre, through whoſe authoritie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation they may be preferred: for the faith and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured credit of all warlike and worthy Souldiers doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon men of valour, and not of weake authoritie, ſmall valor; and great abuſe of the ignorant and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-people, called the beaſt with many heades. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let them euer obſerue the honor of the good and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous: for ſince that in time of warres euery ſouldier of good conditions doth ſharpen his wit, and willingly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture his life, not reſpecting toyles or trauell, expences or danger, but doth imploy his induſtrie to preferre his Princes profite, by great reaſon in time of peace he ought to be aduanced and maintained by them: and much the more for himſelfe, is to vſe all his indeauour to compaſſe his owne commoditie, and thereby make manifeſt his proper vertue, the which doth not conſiſt in outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of valour and diſcretion: but in the true action thereof, agreeable to his honourable profeſſion.</p>
               <p>A ſouldier muſt apparell himſelfe in the warres with cloth of freſh colour, profitable and commodious: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt, red, murry, tauny and ſcarlet makes a galant ſhew in the field, which he muſt weare to honour the militarie profeſſion, and for his moſt fit and apt wearing, and not to hinder the diſpoſition of his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:181245:18"/> as doth our great bumbaſted and bolſtered hoſe, which not many yeeres ſince hath beene vſed: but in ſteed of them a ſtraite brabantie and gaſcaine is to bee worne, together with a cloſe caſſocke, which may ſhield both his flaske, tutch-box, his match and peece from raine if need be, whereby he may be ready to execute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny enterpriſe he is commanded to performe, and that of neceſſitie he ought to doe: and ſo arme himſelfe in other reſpects, that he may readily doe any ſeruice hee is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned vnto.</p>
               <p>He muſt be willing to put in proofe all things comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, without making reply, or denying any one thing, or deferring the matter from one time to another, either for feare of ſpoiling or ſpotting his apparell in foule-way, or foule-weather, or that he ſhall not be able to inioy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious lodging, ſtore of victuals, and ſuch other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, not to be eſteemed of, but worthy great reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Therefore it is requiſite he practiſe himſelfe firſt of all to be a perfect priuate Souldier, before he be drawne to the deſire of bearing office, which were to ſet the cart before the horſes, and worke by contraries: for firſt wee muſt learne to obey, and then it is lawfull to gouerne. But it is no new thing, nor to be maruelled at, that ſome men are accuſtomed to obtaine charges by vnlawfull and indirect meanes, I will not ſay, that they vſe them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. Therefore to merite a charge, it is alwaies farre more excellent and more conuenient to winne them by deſert, then to enter theteinto by intruſion: for thoſe that doe not begge them doe feele in themſelues their proper ſufficiencie: where contrariewiſe they are a heauie bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to thoſe that know them not, although with great inſtance they haue procured and ſought for them. Which
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:181245:19"/> want and vnwarie dealing in this our age, peraduenture proceedes of the ſmall neede the world ſeemes to haue of good Souldiers at this day, and of the little experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence moſt men in our time haue of the Art of warre or at leaſtwiſe our Superiours are blinded with the ſweete baites of couetouſneſſe, cheife cauſe of ſuch elections. Yet this notwithſtanding we ought to retaine with all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, the honour and credite due to an expert and good Souldier, who with diligence being ſought for and ſelected, as neere as is poſſible, ought to haue the moſt choſen charges, and expeditions giuen to their gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. To the end thoſe affaires may fall out happily, to the honour of their Nation and profit of their Prince. Whilſt he doth follow the warres, or is in Campe: let him carrie as little baggage with him as is poſſible, that he may be the more nimble and light of body, ſpeedy in his iourney or marching, and the more apt for all enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes.</p>
               <p>During the warres (or elſe not) he ought to weare in ſome conuenient place of his garments, that is moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant to the view of the band, a token, red croſſe, or ſcarfe, whereby in skirmiſhes and other attempts he is to be knowne of what part he is (the Emperials vſe a red ſcarfe, Engliſhmen <hi>Saint Georges Croſſe,</hi> the French the <hi>White-croſſe,</hi> &amp;c.) or ſuch a ſigne as the Generall of the field ſhall make choiſe of, which he ought to do willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, thereby to remoue ſuſpition out of the minde of his Captaine and Cheifteines, that they need not to ſtand in doubt of him: and for diuers other worthy reſpects, ſince that by theſe and like manifeſt meanes, the Souldier ſhewes inward faith and loialty to the Officers and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines which gouerne. But if otherwiſe they carrie the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:181245:19"/> ſaid token and marke looſe at their necke, breaſt, armes, or any other place, it giues matter and occaſion of doubt touching their fidelitie: ſpecially being but newly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, ſince that being not made faſt, they may eaſily caſt away or hide the ſame in time of perill or doubtfull fight: Which ſuſpition ought diligently to be remoued by him which carrieth an entire deſire and full intent to deale truely and loially.</p>
               <p>He ought likewiſe to beware, vnder paine of great pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, for running from one campe to another, for what occaſion ſoeuer ſhall vrge him to it, but is bound to ſerue that partie with which hee doth firſt place him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, euen vntill the end of the wars.</p>
               <p>I haue ſeene it likewiſe not lawfull, that a Captaine ſhould receiue into his ſeruice a Souldier that is departed from another Captaine of the ſame faction, and this was obſerued, to the end that Souldiers ſhould be kept obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient and ſtedfaſt vnder their Enſigne, where firſt they haue placed themſelues. Prouided alwaies, that their Captaines intreat them honeſtly and well, which is to be decided by the Marſhall of the field. Neuertheleſſe, ſo often as a Souldier is forced of neceſſitie to leaue the warres, he ought not to depart out of his ſeruice, but by the ſpeciall licence of his Captaine, accompanied with an autentike paſport of his good ſeruice, ſo ſhall he ſhun many confuſions which are great occaſions of ſcandals and infinite troubles, by meanes whereof he may freely make relation of the good ſeruice he hath done, and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew himſelfe before any mans face.</p>
               <p>He ought to take ſpeciall care, that he be not the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginner and occaſion of any diſcords and mutinies, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſent thereunto, what reaſon ſoeuer ſhould lead
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:181245:20"/> him thereunto, ſince that ſuch peruerſe proceeding doth not agree with the worthy, noble, and famous Art of warre, which is a dangerous diſcredite to ſuch malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, and for the moſt part without any recouery doth procure the generall ruine of many valiant Captaines and mighty armies. And therefore Ruffians and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Hackers that liue idle in the ſtreetes at home, and follow the wars onely for ſpoile, are moſt vnfit to make Souldiers, for experience makes manifeſt, that they are the onely cauſe of mutinies, ſo that one ſuch is able to corrupt and diſorder a whole band. Wherefore a good Souldier ought rather to apply himſelfe to ſuffer things impoſſible, then commit ſo great an error, for by the one great honour and praiſe ſhall redound vnto him, and by the other vile act, he ſhall gaine manifeſt blame and aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed death: for ſuch notable errors, without any remiſſion, or any pitie (as in part I haue before touched, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in the marſhall lawes ſhall ſet downe) are ſeuerely to be chaſtiſed.</p>
               <p>When the Companie doth diſband, and euery ſouldier is to go to his lodging or cabbin, it is very requiſite hee ſtay vntill ſuch time as he ſee the Enſigne lapt vp and lodged, to the intent, if he be of the gard about the ſame, that night he may attend to doe his dutie, otherwiſe hee may lawfully depart, and thereby ſhunne the ſhamefull name of a ſtubborne, licentious and diſobedient perſon. He muſt learne to vnderſtand the aſſured ſound of the drumme, thereby to know alwaies whereunto he is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and what thing is to be done and obeied, which of duty is accuſtomed to be done, ſince that with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument Souldiers are giuen to vnderſtand, during the warres, what things be neceſſarie to be executed: One
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:181245:20"/> thing beſides is moſt neceſſarie for a Souldier, which is, that he learne perfitly to ſwimme, both for that waters cannot alwaies be paſſed with wading, neither at all times boates and bridges can be conueied with the campe, by reaſon of naughtie paſſages, as alſo in diuers enterpriſes a man is both more ſafe and more bold, knowing what he can doe: whereof young <hi>Shelley</hi> made a moſt famous proofe, who at the victualing of <hi>Midleborow,</hi> when their nauie was aſſaulted by the <hi>Fluſhingers,</hi> hauing all his companie ſlaine, ſwam a ſhore with his armes, being the laſt man left aliue a ſhipbord: and as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at the paſſage of the arme of the ſea, when they went to beſiege <hi>Siricke-ſea.</hi> Beſides the notable attempt made at the great riuer of <hi>Alba</hi> in <hi>Saxonie,</hi> the yeere 1547. where the Imperialiſts had ſo famous a victorie.</p>
               <p>Now therefore let no man perſwade himſelfe, that the ſeuerall and particular experience which belongs to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect good Souldier, can be perfectly and duely obtained by any other way, but by a continuall delight, exerciſe, and obſeruation. For no man doth bring any worke to perfection, whereof he hath not the Art: euery Art doth ſpring of experience and knowledge, and knowledge doth ariſe by meanes of ſtudie and continuall practiſe. Military profeſſion being then more perfect and aboue all other Arts, conſequently it is neceſſarie wee vſe in the ſame greater ſtudie, and more continuall exerciſe then is to be vſed in any other Art: for ſo much as it is a moſt auncient and prudent ſentence: All arts doe conſiſt in exerciſe: and therefore continually at idle times it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fit and neceſſarie for a ſouldier, to practiſe and exerciſe himſelfe amongſt his Companions in the campe, in run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, leaping, throwing the barre, or ſuch like, to make
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:181245:21"/> him actiue, and to auoide ſuch idle paſtimes as Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers commonly now adaies vſe, contrarie to all good order.</p>
               <p>Beſides which, as I haue partly touched before, euery priuate Souldier ought not onely to be well able to vſe the weapon hee ſerueth withall, but alſo ſuddainely to vnderſtand all commandements of his Gouernors, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be by voice or ſound of drumme or otherwiſe, and to know how to maintaine himſelfe in order without breaking aray, not onely marching, but alſo turning in a troupe or retiring. For that Souldier which knoweth his dutie how to behaue himſelfe in the campe, in watch, ſcout &amp;c. and likewiſe in marching, turning, retiring, and fighting or skirmiſhing to obſerue the order pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by his Captaiue, may be called a trained and old Souldier: Whereof if he be ignorant, although he haue beene twentie yeares in the warres, he is not to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Souldier. But in theſe exerciſes the Sergeants and Officers are daily and duely to inſtruct generally and priuately each ſouldier, which Officers ought of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to haue knowledge in reading, that both what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before, and ſhall be written after in this booke, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally touching the Marſhall lawes of the fielde, they may euer read as a Lecture to their ſouldiers, being in <hi>corps de gard,</hi> or at other ſit and conuenient times. For theſe be things ſo neceſſarie to be knowne and obſerued, that it doth both import very much that each ſouldier ſhould haue them by heart, and if it were poſſible, ſowed vpon their garments to be a perpetuall glaſſe to looke into, whereby they might guide all their actions, that thereby they might ſee what they ought to ſhunne for feare of puniſhment, and what to imbrace to increaſe credit.</p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:181245:21"/>
               <p>To knit vp this our firſt diſcourſe, he that findes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſufficient and well inclined to exerciſe this moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent profeſſion, ought with all modeſt humilitie, and good intention, frame himſelfe to a perfect obedience, aſwell to obſerue order, a thing ſo conuenient and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie in this exerciſe, as alſo to execute that which ſhall be commanded him by his Captaine.</p>
               <p>Before a Souldier binde himſelfe to ſerue in a band, he ought aduiſedly to conſider, and expreſly to perſwade himſelfe, that vnder an expert, valorous, and worthy Captaine, ſeldome or neuer our trauaile in well doing is forgotten or loſt: when as the contrarie doth chance vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe that be vaine, vicious, and of ſmall experience, who through want of perfection and practiſe, doe not know the merit of the valiant and valorous acts of a good Souldier: ſo that conſequently they neglect all toile and trauell done in any honourable enterpriſe. Therefore it behoues a Souldier to make a good choiſe at the firſt, for after whatſoeuer he be, he muſt ſtill obey him: and likewiſe alwaies haue reſpect, and carrie a reuerence to the iuſtice of Marſhall law, and the Miniſters of the ſame, though they be of baſe condition, ſince both by the law of Nature and Nations, they ought to be obeyed and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, and particularly knowne, and had in memory of euery priuate ſouldier: for thereby both horſemen and footemen are kept in perfect order.</p>
               <p>But aboue all things a ſouldier ought not to forget his dutie and deuotion towards the goodneſſe of our Lord God, and our ſacred Chriſtian religion, by which the true gift of vertue, valour and fortitude, and all good things beſide, we moſt certainely receiue, and are aſſured to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine whilſt our determinations be lawfull and honeſt.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:181245:22"/> And for that a ſouldier being ſubiect to a thouſand daily dangers, it behoues him continually to liue as he dare die, and oftentimes to reconcile himſelfe to God by confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his ſinnes, and receiue the benefit of the moſt bleſſed Sacrament.</p>
               <p>I haue beene ſomewhat more copious in this firſt diſcourſe touching a ſouldier, then perchance I meane to be in any of the reſt, by reaſon this is the firſt ſteppe and degree a man ought to ſet his feete vpon, before he mount the throne of perfect gouernment in Marſhall affaires: for if a ſouldier can obtaine tried experience in this firſt point, he may with more eaſe aſcend the other, ſince this is onely the ground worke of all the reſt.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> The Office which appertaines to a Corporall, Cape de Squadre, Diſnier, or chiefe of Chamber.</head>
               <p>IT is not to be doubted, but that all notable errors de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend onely of idleneſſe, and that all worthy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable acts ſpring of vigilant warineſſe. Therefore a Corporall, Cape de Squadre, Diſnier, or chiefe of Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or how you liſt to terme them, ought to be no leſſe prudent and carefull ouer the gouernment of his people, then a father in ruling of his family: and as euery parent doth paſſe in age his children, euen ſo a Corporall ſhould be ſuch, that he may exceede any ſouldier, if not by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and yeeres, at leaſtwiſe with diligence and ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of wit. Through which endeauour and exerciſe, ioyned with a feruent deſire and delight, to attaine to the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:181245:22"/> perfit tip of this honourable profeſſion, he ſhall euery day become more capeable, and of greater experience: wherefore I would as neere as is poſſible, not onely haue him expreſly acquainted with the aduertiſements and Martiall lawes following, but alſo indued with the beſt of thoſe conditions which I haue ſet out in my former diſcourſe of a priuate Souldier, ſince that to mount vp to this ſecond degree, it is very neceſſary and requiſite, that he haue made long abode in the practiſe and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in the firſt ſtep of ſeruice appertaining to a priuate Souldier. The Captaine muſt ſelect and chooſe foure of the moſt skilfull Souldiers, which be honeſt, loyall, and perfect religious Chriſtians, out of euery Hundreth in his band: whereof two are to haue charge of the ſhot, the other two of the pikes, euery one guiding 24. a piece, the which ought all of them to be lodged together, and the Corporall himſelfe in the middeſt of his charge, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by when any ſecret ſeruice is to be done, they may call and aſſemble by the appointment of the Superiour offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, their whole ſquadron, or what leſſe number elſe, without the ſound of any drumme.</p>
               <p>Now then a Corporall with his ſquadron of 25. or more, according to the diſcretion of the Captaine, lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together with his company, muſt prouide generally for all their reaſonable wants of wages, match, pouder, and other munition, and muſt inſtruct them how to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle their weapons. He muſt likewiſe remember perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly how euery one is armed and furniſhed when he receiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them in charge, and to ſee that no part thereof be ſpoiled but preſerued neat and trimme: and aboue all things to looke well to the behauiour of his companie, not ſuffering them to vſe vnlawfull and prohibited gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:181245:23"/> neither to giue themſelues to drinking and ſurfeting, but to ſpare of their pay to furniſh themſelues brauely and ſurely againſt the enemie, wherein he ought to vſe his chiefe indeauour. And if it happen that any fault is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, his part is not violently to puniſh the Souldier himſelfe, as hereafter is touched: but to make it knowne to his Captaine, who muſt not neither, as ſome raſhly do, reuenge himſelfe, but communicate the ſame with the Marſhall or his Prouoſt, who onely haue vnder the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall authoritie to puniſh: and this due courſe of iuſtice ſhall be more terrible to the Souldier, and breed leſſe euill-will in them to the Captaine and Officers: general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in theſe reſpects, the Corporall muſt touching the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid cauſes or ſuch like, or it any Souldier be ſicke, hurt, or abſent, by way of impriſonment or death, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make report thereof, finding any thing worthy rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſpare no man, but deliuer ouer the truth to the Sergeant, the Sergeant from him, or together with the Corporall to the Lieutenant, and he or they all iointly to the Captaine, who is to take order in the cauſe. Thus ſhall dignitie of Officers be maintained, and Officers and faults redreſſed, to the great example of the euill, and comfort of the good. But ſomewhat more amply to ſet downe the foreſaid reſpects together with certaine other aduertiſements. A Corporall muſt alwaies fore-ſee and examine, that the ſouldiers of his Squadron keepe their armes in order, cleane and intire: and the Hargabuſiers ſtored with match, bullets and pouder, and ſuch like ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries: a thing worthy to be noted and obſerued in this profeſſion: the which makes ſhew that the ſame is of a good ſouldier not onely vſed in time of warre, but in all other times and places, being a knowne difference
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:181245:23"/> betwixt the legitimate, and leud Profeſſors of armes. He ought of neceſſity ſtill to inſtruct and exhort them, that they liue together friendly, without diſcord: that they be modeſt and ſparing in their victuals, profitable in their apparell, and that generally they doe ſhun ſwearing, and blaſpeming vpon greeuous puniſhment, by which act of blaſpheming and ſwearing by the holy name of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Trinitie, they commit greater villany and offence before God, then if before the world they did commit moſt wicked acts, or infinite errors. Likewiſe let him prohibite all vnlawfull games, for the performance whereof he ought to proceede with as great dexteritie and curteſie as he can, that alway in matters of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, he may haue that due obedience which is required, and not through crueltie gaine the hate and euill-will of thoſe perſons, which in many other things beſide are to obey him: for to chaſtiſe them, lies neither in his power, neither in the arbitriment of other Officers, although they be of degrees higher then he, but doth iuſtly apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the Office of the Maſter of the Campe, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall of the field. The which point is to be noted and obſerued, to the diſcredite of ſome Captaines, which at this day delight to imbrew their murthering hands in the bloud of ſouldiers, and men perchance of honeſt beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, being moued thereunto through ſome hatred, toy, or beaſtly paſſion.</p>
               <p>Therefore he muſt alwaies be mindfull to obſerue this honourable rule of diuers good and diſcreet Officers, who ſometimes doe ouer-ſee and winke at light faults, and proceed with a certaine modeſtie and lenitie, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in matters of greater inſolencie, with ſeueritie.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding theſe and ſuch like authorities, the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:181245:24"/> Corporall ought to be no leſſe obedient to euery leaſt point of the Marſhall lawes: and in ranke and aray, or in other places where thoſe of greater gouernment be, he muſt performe and obſerue the part and dutie of a priuate Souldier, and retaine like order and obedience: for where our betters be, the leſſe giue place.</p>
               <p>But when alone with his ſquadron he is conducted to the place where he is to make watch and ward: then muſt he take vpon him his office, and make prouiſion of wood or coles, that he may alwaies haue fire burning in his corps of gard, aſwell in the day as in the night, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well in the ſummer as in the winter: without which hee ought neuer to keepe watch, becauſe it is a moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie munition for the Hargabuſiers, to light their match withall, and for other needfull reſpects. Likewiſe hee muſt prouide for oyle, for candles for the night time, for lant-hornes and ſuch like at the Sergeant Maiors hands, or of ſome others, who haue charge to prouide for thoſe things, and are accuſtomed to diſtribute the ſame. If hee keepe his corps de gard in an open and plaine place or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe: he muſt conforme the company of his ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, according to the order appointed by his betters: and with the moſt ſpeedy and artificiall manner that he can, muſt arme and fortifie with ditches, trenches, and ſentinels, the place where he muſt make his abode with this his ſmall band and troupe of ſouldiers, the better to reſiſt the enemies furie, or any ſurpriſe he might aſſault him withall, conſidering that ſometimes, yea and that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often, being ſet vpon, the Sentinels and corps de gard be repulſed and haue their throates cut, to the great diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance and vniuerſall domage of the whole Campe. He muſt ordaine his watch in ſuch a place, that in the ſame at
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:181245:24"/> all times he may remaine warie and vigilant, placing himſelfe in the moſt high and eminent ſeate of all the corps de gard, to the intent that hee may know and diſcerne in due time euery particular accident that ſhall happen or ſucceede: and thereof immediately aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe his Captaine of all, that he may prouide remedy with ſpeed, according as the caſe requires warily and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, euen at the cloſing of the night, vntill the bright ſpring of the <hi>Diana,</hi> and faire day-light: he muſt ordaine and place Sentinels, and often ſearch and viſite them, with the aide of two of the Captaines Gentlemen of his company, called of the <hi>Italians Lanze Spezzate,</hi> or might be tearmed more aptly, extraordinarie Lieutenants, that he may alwaies remaine vigilant and aſſured, to the intent he be not aſſailed vnprouided, to his great domage, and before he can giue warning of the enemie to the campe, which doth reſt and lie in ſafetie in that quarter where he is, vnder his charge, care, and diligence. In ſuch caſes he ought therefore to imploy the beſt men he hath, that hee neuer reſt deceiued in a matter of ſo great importance, ſince that of thoſe which be but meane Souldiers, or as I may well tearme them, negligent perſons, nothing elſe is to be looked for at their hands, but error, loſſe, and danger.</p>
               <p>Moreouer he muſt at the leaſt cauſe the third part of his ſquadron to remaine and ſtand continually armed at all points, both night and day, conſiſting of greater or leſſe quantity of people, according as the ſuſpition doth argue the neede of them to be ſmall or great: the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabuſiers hauing their flaskes and furniture tied to their girdles, and their peeces ready charged, that vpon a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine they may contend by skirmiſh, according to need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:181245:25"/> occaſion, and readily reſiſt the enemie without ſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or any remiſſion of time, vntill all the ſquadron be put in order.</p>
               <p>He muſt be very circumſpect, that the reſt of the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers weapons, and principally his owne, be laid vp and placed in ſuch order, one kinde being diuided from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that in one inſtant they may be ſpeedily and readily armed: the which he muſt daily put in practiſe, and inure them withall, by fained alarmes, by ſpeciall commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and of ſet purpoſe, which be moſt neceſſarie to be practiſed before hand for diuers honourable and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant reſpects, worthy to be had in good conſideration.</p>
               <p>Therefore let him haue and carie a continuall care, that their armes neuer remaine in any confuſed order, the which if he ſhould ſuffer, he ſhould find no doubt to be a great want: but the ſame may be preuented, and made eaſie, by accommodating the Hargabuſiers in rancke one by one, vpon a boord or banke: the Pikes and Corſlets, in order reared and hanged vpon ſome wall or other apt place in the corps de gard, and vpon each particular wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon and peece, euery ſouldier ſhould haue a proper and ſpeciall marke before hand made whereby to know the ſame. He ought daily to inſtruct his ſquadron euery one apart, how to handle the weapon wherewith they ſerue: the Hargabuſier to charge and diſcharge nimbly, the Pikeman to toſſe his pike with great dexteritie.</p>
               <p>Sentinels ought with great reaſon to be placed about the corps of gard, to the intent the ſame may be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and kept with more ſafety and ſecuritie. Hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe at the cloſing of the night, muſt place the firſt Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinell, and ſo conſequently the reſt, inſtructing them or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly what manner they haue to obſerue, and how they
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:181245:25"/> ought to gouerne themſelues in ſuch accidents as might inſue: who are to remaine in Sentinell in winter and cold weather, but one houre, or two at the moſt: but in ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, two or three houres before they be changed: for which reſpect, that euery one may be taxed with aequity, let him firſt make a iuſt diuiſion of his number, according to the number of the houres in the night, and following that proportion, let him ſee the ſame performed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fauouring or omitting any, the which hee may the more certainely performe, if the names of his Souldiers be written in a roll, and when the houre glaſſe hath runne their time (which is neceſſarie for him to haue in his corps de gard) then to pricke their names, and place new in their roomes, ſo ſhall each Souldier be partaker of the trauaile, and reſt maruellouſly well ſatisfied. But for that in wars, canuiſados, ſurpriſes, ſallies, ſuch like caſualties and aduertiſements be infinite, I will leaue the reſt to his owne vigilant diſcretion, and ſuppoſe it needleſſe to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſe him of euery particular point; more then that I haue and will touch in this my firſt booke of <hi>Militarie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,</hi> as caſes moſt proper for priuate Souldiers. I therefore at this preſent thinke it ſufficient for a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to know, that it is neceſſarie he ſhould ſo diſpoſe the matter through his prouident prouiſion, that all his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may be reduced into order, and already haue taken their weapons in their hands, before the enemie giue charge vpon them. And therefore in time and place of ſuſpition and danger, he muſt place loſt Sentinels with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the watch-word, a good diſtance off, from the corps de gard, in places moſt ſuſpect. But in other places not needfull ſo much to be ſuſpected, and that be neerer him, he ought to ſet Sentinels with the watch-word, ſo farre
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:181245:26"/> one from an other, as it ſhall ſeeme vnto him reaſonable or requiſite, and that they may inuiron the ground one within the ſight of an other, or ſo that the enemy cannot enter, or any eſpion iſſue without their knowledge. If great occaſion ſo demaund, let him place together one Hargabuſier, and one armed Pike, to the intent that the one may keepe the enemie farre off, and in a certaine ſort ſuſtaine his fury at the point of his pike, whilſt the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabuſier with the diſcharge of his peece, giues Arme to the corps de gard and campe, which exploit may be the better performed, if a corporall-ſhippe of Pikemen bee ioyned together with an other of ſhot. Sometimes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any noyſe or rumour, Arme is giuen to the campe, for one of the two Sentinels may retire, and make relation to the Corporall what hath appeared, been ſince, heard or happened, whereby he may ſpeedily with great ſilence giue Arme to the gard, without leauing the place of the Sentinell diſarmed, which they ought neuer to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon, but at ſuch times as the enemie is manifeſtly diſcouered, the occaſion of the alarme being certaine, at which time being retired, they muſt vnite themſelues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the ſouldiers of the gard, that they may all wholy in one company execute that which ſhall fall out beſt for their purpoſe, which is, to retire fighting or skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhing to the campe, according to ordinarie cuſtome, notwithſtanding by the order and appointment of thoſe which haue authority to commaund them, as their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, Sergeant maior, &amp;c. but neuer otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>He ought moreouer to be circumſpect, that in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the watch a ſolemne ſecret ſilence be kept, without ſinging, brawling, or any rumour or noiſe, and ſpecially in the night, both in reſpect of the enemie, to heare when
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:181245:26"/> the alarme is giuen, and to the intent that thoſe which reſt and ſleepe, and are not yet in Sentinell, may be the more apt to reſiſt and apply themſelues to theſe actions and exerciſes, which are required of them with vigilant watchfulneſſe, ſince a man cannot without great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie remaine without ſleepe or reſt, any much longer time then our nature is accuſtomed by ordinarie courſe to beare, and therefore at the entrance of the corps de gard, he ought likewiſe to keepe a proper Sentinell appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the gard, that neither friend nor enemie comming out of the campe or elſewhere, ſhall be able to enter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out yeelding the watch-word: and in this ſort muſt the Corporall proceed, euen vntill the diaua bee ſounded through all the Campe. For other reſpects, I finally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre him to my following diſcourſe, which together with that written before, it is requiſite he haue in perfit memorie as well as the priuate ſouldier.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> How a Souldier may maintaine obedience, and keepe himſelfe in the fauour and good grace of his Captaine.</head>
               <p>A Good Souldier ought to haue conſideration, that ſince due orders and lawes are the aſſured founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſtay of euery ſtate: and contrariwiſe, diſcord and diſobedience the ruine of all Realmes: ſo that aboue all things a well gouerned Generall, and a carefull Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, ought prudently to fore-ſee that their Campe and Souldiers be paid and puniſhed with equall execution of iuſtice, not reſpecting perſon: yeelding to the Offenders puniſhment, and reward to the vertuous: depreſſing vice, and exalting vertue: vſing commendation to the good, and correction to the euill, ioyned with admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of magnanimitie, the which if they preuaile not, to chaſtiſe them: and as the good huſband doth plucke the weedes out of the good corne, to the intent that they by their wicked and pernicious example, do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the reſt, and conſequently doth prouide that no fault paſſe vnpuniſhed, nor no valorous act vnrewarded: by which meanes he becomes feared, fauoured, obeyed, and beloued of all the armie: euen ſo on the other ſide, the good natured ſouldier muſt euer haue reſpect to keepe the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:181245:28"/> bondes of modeſty towards his Superiour, and yeelde many thankes to God, that he hath giuen him ſo iuſt and vertuous a Captaine and Generall, towards whom hee muſt alwaies yeeld like obedience, that the ſonne doth to the father, being bound ſo to doe by the diuine law, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhewing himſelfe oppoſite to the order of generall iuſtice, nor vngratefull for his receiued benefits, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually by his good guiding in the one and the other, giue his Captaine iuſt cauſe to loue and like well of him.</p>
               <p>Souldiers be euer bound to obey the iuſtice and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of their Superiours: and the Superiour likewiſe to embrace the obedience of his Souldiers, whilſt he doth ſee himſelfe honoured and obeyed of them, either in deedes or words, in earneſt or diſſembling.</p>
               <p>Although the Generall or Captaine were a right <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danapalus,</hi> ſo that his lawes be obeyed all things fall out well: wherefore a Souldier ought with all his indeauour to be obedient to the law, with his whole heart loue his Captaine, and feare him with all his force.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cyrus</hi> being cruell, couetous, miſerable, and an Exacter of taxes, through iuſtice was beloued and obeyd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cambyſes, Marcus Cato,</hi> and <hi>Marcus Antonius,</hi> the two firſt being ſeuere and cruell, yet amongſt the Souldiers were maruellouſly fauoured: and the third, although hee was drowned in the deepe and gaping gulfe of Lechery, Gluttony, and riotous gaming, yet was he ſo beloued of his armie, that his Souldiers would haue ſuffered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be crucified, to haue done any thing gratefull vnto him, and that cheifly through his iuſtice: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it behoues a Souldier to keepe inuiolate the Martiall lawes of the field. But to touch the cheifeſt meanes whereby a Souldier may be drawne to obey, to feare, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:181245:29"/> loue the Captaine, and altogether gaine his good liking and fauour, carie in minde what inſueth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, a Souldier muſt preſume and perſwade himſelfe, that whatſoeuer he doth in ſecret, that it ſhall come to the knowledge of the Captaine, whether it be good or euill: which feare if he be wiſe, will reſtraine him from doing any thing pernicious, or againſt the Marſhall law, or the miſliking of the Captaine, and ſo ought to reſt in continuall doubt, leſt his euill deedes come to light, and to the eares of the ſuperiour Officers, that with the ſword of iuſtice, the rod of reuenge, and the ſcepter of rule, may and will chaſtice him. If he remember this, no doubt he will liue modeſtly, in obſeruing thoſe lawes which are commanded by the Captaine and Generall: for it behoues a ſouldier ſtill to liue in ſuſpect, that ſpials and intelligencers be euer preſent at his elbow, which no doubt will accuſe him for his euill behauiour: of which ſort a Captaine and Generall haue great ſtore to keepe the Campe and Souldiers in continuall ſuſpicion and feare.</p>
               <p>A Souldier muſt euer ſhew himſelfe gratefull to his Captaine in words and deeds, by remaining patient in his actions, and not to vſe complaints in his ſpeeches ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with quiet contentation the penurie of victuals, if the Campe ſhould want, either through fault of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, bareneſſe of the Countrey, or otherwiſe by his negligence, or through the malignitie of fortune, that neither by water nor land corne and victuals can be brought to them in ſafetie: wherefore we muſt weare out this want patiently, and not with a melancholike coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, make appearance of a wrathfull and furious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by charging of the Chiefetaine openly with thoſe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:181245:29"/> wants: for which proceeding, let him aſſure himſelfe that he ſhall be eſteemed of euery man an inſolent, ſeditious, and impatient ſouldier. Murmure not againſt thy Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine with thy tongue, but rather lament in thy heart thy euill fortune, reſting content with that portion of victuals his Sergeant ſhall giue thee for that day. Seeme ioyfull whilſt thy Captaine is merry, and ſorrowfull when he is grieued, yeelding comfort and conſolation, together with faithfull counſell, as the cauſe requireth.</p>
               <p>Shew not thy ſelfe full of wrath and malcontent, for want of thy wonted pay, although thou manifeſtly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the ſame to proceed of the couetouſneſſe of thy Captaine: but diſſemble and ſhew him ſo gratefull a countenance, that he thereby may be moued to pay the band, if not all, at the leaſt part. If theſe delayes proceed not by his fault, and that therefore hee laments thy lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring want: make free offer vnto him to ſuffer all lacke and diſcommoditie to pleaſure him withall: whereby he ſhall be maruellouſly moued, and much more bound to loue a curteous ſouldier.</p>
               <p>Doe not moleſt him with demaunding more ſuccour and preſt-money, then thou haſt need of, yea and that when needy force conſtraines.</p>
               <p>Report not any thing but that which is profitable and beneficiall for the publike State: for otherwiſe thou ſhalt be accounted a malicious Detractour, inſolent, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable, making rehearſall of euery little trifle, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hatred is gained in exchange of gaining fauour. Faile neuer in the diligent execution of thy duty, and make ſhew of thy forwardneſſe, euen purpoſely with the firſt, euen in thoſe things that appertaine not to thy charge.</p>
               <p>Diſobey not the Captaines or Generals precepts, nor
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:181245:30"/> withſtand the martiall lawes: neither affirme that any thing is euill wrought which is done, for it appertaines not to a ſouldier to reprehend: but to a Councellor to admoniſh. Do not importune thy Captaine to reward thy trauell and ſeruice, but attend his liberalitie: for if thou become importunate, he will likewiſe become <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Craſſus,</hi> who at the firſt vſing great liberality, being continually and ouermuch craued, became at the laſt extreame couetous.</p>
               <p>Preſent him neuer with any thing, ſpecially with any thing of value: for thy captaine which hath no neede of that which is thine, and perceiuing thee to preſent him that which is not correſpondent to the merite of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe will eſteeme the ſame to be done in manner of merchandiſe, as proceeding of craft: but if thy Captaine demaund any thing vnder ſhew of praiſing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the ſame, or the beautie thereof, it is then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that the ſame be liberally beſtowed vpon him, it being a curteous demaund, which hee commonly will magnificently recompence, as did <hi>Artaxerxes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Accept neuer any thing of thy enemy ſouldier, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther receiue any letter, yea if it ſhould be from thy father, without licence of thy Captaine Generall, as a thing which only appertaines to Councellors and Chieftaines: for thy Captaine would become iealous ouer thy fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſuſpecting that thou wert corrupted. There is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther note, ſpecially to aduertiſe all ſouldiers of, that they doe not raſhly, neither of purpoſe diſdaine to be gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and commaunded of a Captaine, which is perchaunce of no auncient houſe, as an infinite number of fond and preſumptuous fellowes doe now adaies: who being rude and ruſticall Clownes, diſdaine to be guided by Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:181245:30"/> whoſe valour and vertue, and not whoſe auncient ſtocke, hath giuen them that degree, being aſcended to ſo high honour by the ſteps of vertue: for I haue ſeene ſome that but lately haue left their nedles, their hammers, and their ſpades, hauing ſcarce ſeene a ſmall skirmiſh, but that they preſume themſelues to be expert Souldiers, and will ſay, what is my Captaines valour more then mine? Is not he of baſe degree as well as I? not conſidering that we be all ſprung out of one ſtocke, but that our valour and vertue hath made vs noble, as hath beene verified in diuers Princes, Kings and Emperours, as <hi>Caius Marius, Lucius Quintus Cincinatus, Attilius Collatinus, Valentinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Maximinianus, Franciſco Carmognuolo, Iulian Romero,</hi> and <hi>Mondragon,</hi> beſides diuers others moe, which at this day doe liue, being exalted by the degrees and way of vertue, to the tippe of ſuch praiſe as is moſt conuenient to worthy Captaines: and therefore no ſouldier ought to diſdaine to be gouerned by ſuch, whoſe vertue hath made noble their mindes.</p>
               <p>And moreouer, if any ſuch a one that is become Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, either by meanes of fauour or vertue, bee blotted with ſome vice or defect, yet wee ought not to diſobey him: for <hi>Caeſar</hi> was ambitious, great <hi>Alexander</hi> a Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard; <hi>Hanniball</hi> vnfaithfull, cruell, and without religion; <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> by lingring eſteemed a Coward; <hi>Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> raſh and vnaduiſed: And therefore although thy Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine be accounted moſt vicious yet if he know how to gouerne and guide his charge, a ſouldier muſt obey him, and neither calumniouſly reprehend him, nor corruptly imitate and obſerue his vices, but duely and directly ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill his precepts: ſo that no ſouldier or Gentleman, of what Great-houſe ſoeuer, ought to diſdaine to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:181245:31"/> of ſuch as haue riſen by vertue, to the height of honour, neither any man, how great of linage ſoeuer he be, to diſdaine to accept leſſe degrees then a Captaine. For thoſe be the ſteps by the which he muſt aſcend vnto higher dignitie, as many auncient and noble perſonages haue done, who from inferiour degrees by little and little haue come to ſuperiour, whereof the great Emperour <hi>Caius Iulius Caeſar</hi> may be example: who being borne of a noble-houſe amongſt the <hi>Romanes,</hi> was firſt choſen Pretor in <hi>Spaine</hi> (a baſe office in reſpect of his worthy parentage) as being reputed vnworthy of any greater office.</p>

               <p>They muſt likewiſe be aduertiſed which march in the formoſt rankes, if they be vpon the right ſide, to hold their Pikes continually in marching in the right hand, and vpon the right ſhoulder without euer changing it: and ſo likewiſe being vpon the left ſide of the ranke, to hold it alwaies vpon the left ſhoulder: thoſe that be in the midſt of the rankes haue libertie to vſe that ſide that is beſt for their commoditie, either vpon the right or left hand, and to moue their Pikes from ſhoulder to ſhoulder at their choiſe and pleaſure: It is true that the iuſt carying of the Pike of thoſe that march in the midſt of the rankes, is to hold it vpon the left ſhoulder, and to carie their right hand behind vpon their dagger, or vpon their ſide, and ſo generally all, as well they that be in the midſt, as thoſe that be in the head of the rankes are to obſerue this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:181245:44"/> to carie that hand which is at libertie behinde them, or vpon their ſides. Let him march then with a good grace, holding vp his head gallantly, his pace full of grauitie and ſtate, and ſuch as is fit for his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and let his body bee ſtraight and as much vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right as is poſſible, and that which moſt imports, is that they haue alwaies their eies vpon their companions which are in ranke with them, and before them going iuſt one with the other, and keeping perfit diſtance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out committing error in the leaſt pace or ſtep, and euery pace and motion with one accord and conſent, they ought to make at one inſtant time. And in this ſort all the rankes entirely are to go, ſometimes ſoftly, ſomtimes faſt, according to the ſtroke of the drumme. The heele and tippe of their pikes would bee equally holden, both of length and height, as neere as is poſſible, to auoide that they fall not out to be by bearing them otherwiſe, like vnto organ-pipes, ſome long, ſome ſhort. The meaſure and proportion thereof, to hold the heel of the Pike is this: It is neceſſarie for him to haue an eye to the ranke that doth march before him, and ſo carie the Butt-end or heele of his pike, that it may bee iuſt ouer againſt the ioynt of the hamme of the ſouldier, that in march ſhall be ſtraight before him: and ſo euery one from hand to hand muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the proportion of that height, that is right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind vpon the ioynt of the knee, for by doing ſo they cannot commit error, carying in their march that legge that is vnder that arme that ſuſtaines and caries the Pike of iuſt and euen proportion, by mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their pace right vnder the ſtaffe of the Pike, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their march, as I haue ſaid before, iuſt and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:181245:44"/> euen, with a gallant and ſtately, and ſumptuous pace: for by doing ſo, they ſhall be eſteemed, honoured, and commended of the Lookers on, who ſhall take wonderfull delight to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them march in that order.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince euery Officer through his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall exerciſe and daily diligence in executing his charge, doth at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto perfit experience by dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practiſe, which is as it were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted into nature: therefore hee which determines with himſelfe to be accounted ſufficient and of abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, to diſcharge the place of a good Sergeant of a band, with a forward intent to learne and be thorowly inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ought firſt to be a Souldier that hath ſeene much,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:181245:45"/> and a Corporall of good experience, according to the directions of my firſt booke: In which two roomes it is very conuenient, that he haue taſted and beene preſent at great diuerſitie of ſeruice, and warlike enterpriſes, and to carie a reſolute minde to delight in the exerciſe of this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, to the end he be not found therein irreſolute and ignorant: and that likewiſe he faile not in the ready per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of any enterpriſe, when Martiall affaires do call him forth to put the ſame in execution.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all it is very requiſite that he haue moſt perfitly in memorie, the number of all the ſouldiers of the band, and diſtinctly with what weapons they are armed, what quantity of Corſlets and Pikes, how many armed and diſarmed carie ſhort weapons, what number of Harga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſiers with murrians and without, how many musket-eares, how many light armed pikes and targets of proofe, that the better and more readily vpon a ſodaine, hee may put the company in order.</p>
               <p>He muſt euer plant the beſt armed in places moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, as at the front and backe, the right and left ſide of a ſquare. The firſt ranke in ordinarie long marching, the targets of proofe muſt go in as a ready couer and bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke againſt the enemies ſhot: next to them the musket-eares, then the Hargabuſiers, and after them the armed and light pikes: amidſt whoſe rankes he muſt at all times place the Enſigne, garded with Halberds or bils, and then againe the light armed and armed pikes, hargabuſe and musket-eares, and laſt of all targets of proofe: by this equality of diuiſion, the whole band at one inſtant ſhall be ready to receiue any ſuddaine ſurpriſe of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. The Sergeant carrying theſe things in his minde, hauing laid a diſtinct plat, he may very eaſily vary their
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:181245:46"/> forme and order as he ſhall be appointed, and as the ſituation of the place doth require, or the accidents of warre doe conſtraine.</p>
               <p>He muſt neuer worke vnwarily, or at all aduentures, and tending to no determined purpoſe, as thoſe that doe not remember the perfit rules and reckonings of their office, whereof there be now adaies ouer many, for when it is neceſſary for them to alter their order, and that perforce they muſt quite change the forme and faſhion that then they obſerue, they know not which way to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne. Therefore to the end his order and rankes may be to the purpoſe duely and directly changed, and with facilitie diſpoſed: let him euer diſſeuer and diuide one part of his weapons from an other, cauſing euery one to turne and enter into their rankes and order by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, ſo ſhall hee proceed in taking away, ſetting for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and intermixing one ſort of rankes within ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very orderly. And thereby the full proportion of his band ſhall be framed, as he hath determined, or as it is deuiſed by him that commands, either in marching for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and backward, or in turning without diſorder, by 3. 5. 7. or 9. in a ranke, as the Lieutenant, Captaine, or Sergeant maior appoints.</p>
               <p>He ought euer to beware that in ordering the rankes, and appointing the ſoldiers their places, that they begin not to make debate, or ſtomacke one another for dignitie of place; the which doth oftentimes fall out to their great annoy and damage, and the Officers tedious toile: For in enterpriſes of great importance, euen in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the invading enemy, ſome vaine-glorious fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes are accuſtomed to ſtriue for the chiefeſt places: the which roomes by all reaſon, and of dutie appertaine
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:181245:46"/> to the beſt armed, and not to any others, whoſe vnruly raſhnes may be the ruine of the whole band. Therefore fit and conuenient places are to be obſerued with humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, the naked in their places, and the armed in theirs: But to touch one point, which we haue already ſpoken of, I iudge it moſt conuenient that the armed (thoſe for skirmiſh excepted) muſt remaine in maine ſtands and battailes, as ſome ſay, to abide by the ſtake, who ought to be ſo well armed, as they may beare and ſupport the blowes of their enemies, and reſiſt any furious charge, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of horſemen or footmen: whereas beſide their well ordered ranks, by reaſon they be armed, they make a more gallant ſhow; giuing courage to thy owne people, and diſcourage to the enemie, and in proofe are more profitable than the diſarmed, who remaining in their roomes, the contrary ſucceeds.</p>
               <p>The Sargeant of the Company muſt haue ſpeciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard when victuals cannot be had for money, by forrage or otherwiſe, to make repaire togither with the Clarke of the Band, to the principall munitions, that his company taſte not of famine; and from thence procure to haue ſo much as he well can, or as is conuenient, and according to his receiued order, ſo muſt he depart and diſtribute all manner of munitions amongſt the Corporals, that euery one of them may giue to their ſoldiers their portions.</p>
               <p>The like ought he to vſe, touching powder for the Harquebuſiers and musketiers, lead for bullets, match for them to burne, and ech thing elſe whereof they haue neede, to the end they may alwaies remaine in order, and be very well prouided and ſtored, as neere as is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and as is moſt conuenient; and to perſwade the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier that to gaine a place of more account, he will ſpare
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:181245:47"/> his pay to arme himſelfe the more brauely. He muſt likewiſe haue diligent eye, that the ſaid munition of match and powder be conſerued warily from wetting, and kept with a ſpeciall ſpare from vntimely ſpending: for this prouident precept doth import very much in all enterpriſes, by reaſon that the negligence of the Sargeant, touching this neceſſarie fore-ſight and care, hath bin the cauſe that the ſhot haue not bin able readily to performe their duties according to the appointed determinations, or as neceſſitie did require, by reaſon of their vnwary kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping their munition in wet weather, or their generall want through vaine miſpence, by which meanes many and moſt notable errors haue ſucceeded of great loſſe &amp; moment, and to the hinderance, ſhame, and totall ruine of a whole company or campe.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is moſt expedient that the Sargeant, togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the ſeuerall Corporals, do diligently and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly examine, viſit, ſearch, and view the proper flaskes, tuch-boxes, pockets, and other places where the ſoldiers are accuſtomed to carry and keepe their powder and match, and peruſe diligently all thoſe things without negligence, fayning, or fauouring: diuers haue receiued great ignominie and ſhame in their office, for want of the performance thereof: whereas by carrying a contrary care, they haue bin vniuerſally well thought of, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended of all good ſoldiers and valiant Captaines. Therefore as occaſion doth ſerue and offer, he may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh, put in minde, and reprehend with dexteritie the ſoldiers vnder his charge and guiding. To him it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines to lay his helping hands about all things neceſſarie for his company, as well in prouiding for them, as diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, or deferring neceſſary charges, except for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:181245:47"/> and diuiding of lodgings, which is the office of the Furrier or Harbinger, who ought to be very tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, diligent, and altogether officious, not being partiall to any one for peculiar profit or pleaſure, and therefore it is neceſſary a Sargeant ſhould know how to write, for it is hard by memory to diſcharge his charge.</p>
               <p>The Sargeant muſt be carefull to accompanie, at the houre appointed, the guard to the place of the watch, in going vp and downe alongſt their flanks when he hath placed them in order, to ſee them keepe due diſtance, make the Laumband, march in ſtraight line with their ranks, carry their armes in conformable proportion; and if vpon pleaſure they giue a volee of ſhot in paſſing, to aduertiſe them to doe it orderly with due forme, one ranke after another, as they paſſe ouer againſt the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, or other great officer or perſonage and not in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed ſort altogither, or by peeces. When he is arriued at the Corps of guard, and hath placed euery one in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and prouided for all things neceſſarie for the watch of that night, he muſt then giue his aduiſe and counſell to the Corporalls, that they keepe good order in their Sentinels; yea ſometimes and very often, it is good that he himſelfe aide them to choſe out the moſt fit places for them to ſtand in, to the end that the circuit of ground, which for all their ſafeties is to be kept, may be conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently guarded.</p>
               <p>At the ioyning of the day and the night, or ſomwhat later, he ſhall ſecretly giue the Corporalls the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word, with the which they are to gouerne the guard as well by night as day: the which word by the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Captaine, hee muſt procure the <hi>Sargeant maior</hi> to giue him, or of ſome other that ſhall haue the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:181245:48"/> charge to giue the ſame for want of his preſence, or in place of this great officer.</p>
               <p>He muſt arme himſelfe in ſuch ſort, that he be no leſſe apt than any other ſoldier to be able at time of neede, both to defend himſelfe, and offend the enemie: touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which effect, Duke <hi>Octauio Farneſe</hi> in the expedition of 12000 footmen, and 600 horſemen, which <hi>Paul</hi> the third, Pope of Rome, ſent into Germanie againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, did diſpoſe that all the Sargeants of his bands ſhould arme themſelues with Harquebuſes and murri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; ſaying, that ſo great a number of valiant men being Sargeants, as was in ſo great an aſſembly and expedition of ſuch importance, it was neither good nor commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, that they ſhould onely be armed with their Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berds, and therefore he ought to haue his page or Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chacho ſecond him with thoſe furnitures: neither ſeems it inconuenient, but hauing placed in order all things pertaining to his office, that he place himſelfe in ranke with the reſt of the ſoldiers, yet in ſuch a place as he may eaſily depart from thence when neceſſitie cals him away, to reforme or vſe remedie to any diſorder he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands of.</p>
               <p>He muſt with dexteritie proceed in reprehending and exhorting the ſoldiers to keep their due order, and not to diſband and ſtray abroad, but vpon needfull and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full occaſions, and to take order in all other particular points, which are requiſite to be obſerued for the honor and profit of the Company, which things are chiefly to be procured and obſerued by other officers.</p>
               <p>Let him beware and abſtaine from beating of ſoldiers at any time, that thereby he grow not odious: for it is not conuenient nor comely for an officer to ſtrike a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:181245:48"/> for thereby he ſo offends, that he doth incurre the paine to receiue puniſhment for ſo doing, of his Captaine or the Maſter of the Campe.</p>
               <p>He muſt be diligent, carefull, and vigilant in all his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires; for in this office, diligence and dexteritie is both to the purpoſe and moſt neceſſarie.</p>
               <p>It is neceſſarie he be alwaies conformable vnto the <hi>Sargeant maior,</hi> by imitation and obedience in action, and like his ſhadow, to ſecond him in all his doings; of whom he may alwaies receiue information and order of all ſuch things as be neceſſarie for ſeruice of his band: and of him he may learne to proceed by conformitie, in that which is conuenient for his office. For he that is in company with men of vertue and valour, that be of more excellent qualitie than he himſelfe, ſhall euer reape ſome profit; and the rather for that he is bound to be in the ſight, and neere about the <hi>Sargeant maior,</hi> at all ſuch times as any thing is to be done, where he ought with a good eare, and diligent eye, giue ready attendance, to execute ſuch commiſſion as ſhall be giuen him; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thoſe which appertaines to the ordering of the rankes, and euery thing elſe whatſoeuer, without doing any thing vpon his owne iudgment, but conferre with that great officer, towards whom he muſt alwaies be courteous and conformable; and with an obedient and beneuolent minde diligently imitate him.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe it moreouer neceſſarie, as I ſaid before, that he be able to write and read, conſidering the infinite number of things which are to paſſe through his hands, and which he ought to execute for the benefit of his company, which cannot be alwaies ordered, diſpoſed, and guided only by memory: So conſequently the Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:181245:49"/> is to take diligent heed and care of all the foreſaid things to execute the points of his office ſpeedily, and to rebuke and teach ſuch as do amiſſe with lenitie; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he cannot violently ſtrike and hurt any man, yet neuertheleſſe no man can reſiſt his authoritie, but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the ſame as to the Captaines owne perſon, if he were preſent.</p>
               <p>He is not to heare any mutinous or rebellious words amongſt the company, but immediatly to reueale the ſame, that ſpeedy reformation may be had, and faults amended. And thus muſt he be ſtill occupied to reform mens manners, miſpence of munition, broken araies, and to be ready day and night to ſeruice, by the Captaine or Lieutenants commandment, and to inſtruct the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, to march, traine, and trauaile, as well by ſignes from him framed, as otherwiſe by words ſpoken, and to haue ſpeciall regard to the company, to ſee that their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and weapons be in a readineſſe alwaies for ſeruice: for the diligent and skilfull vſage of this office, is of no ſmall moment to any good order throughout the whole band; no leſſe than the Centurion amongſt the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, who was Captaine ouer a hundreth; and ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe euery hundreth in each band ought to haue a ſeueral Sargeant to direct and gouerne.</p>

               <p>IF it be a thing moſt requiſite that a priuate ſoldier ſhould haue a ſpeciall zeale ouer his proper honor and credit; how much more is the ſame neceſſarie for a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:181245:49"/> 
                  <hi>Alfierus</hi> or Enſigne-bearer. Therefore he muſt with all carefull diligence, due diſcretion, aſcend the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> degree of this honorable diſcipline, being already trained vp in the three firſt degrees, which is, of a priuate ſoldier, a Corporall, and a Sargeant, whereby to his great commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation he may ſufficiently merit the ſway of this office.</p>
               <p>Hauing ſolemnly receiued the Enſigne of his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, like a noble and expert ſoldier, he ought carefully to keepe the ſame, and beare a certaine reuerent reſpect to it, as to a holy thing, yea &amp; to be iealous ouer the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thereof, no leſſe than an amorous perſon ouer his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing miſtreſſe: ſince that onely with the ſacred ſhade of the Enſigne, being well guided, the generall reputation of all the band and company is conſerued.</p>
               <p>Therefore the <hi>Alfierus</hi> ought to be endowed with ſuch cuſtome, and vſe himſelfe with ſuch curteſie and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilitie, that he may not only procure the loue of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, and friends, but of all the entire company.</p>
               <p>Beſides, it is neceſſarie to haue neere vnto him a couple of aſſiſtants at the leaſt, that be practiſed and good ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, which may be of the number of the Halberdiers that go next his Enſigne, to the end that when he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to abſent himſelfe from the ſame, through ſome vrgent and neceſſarie occaſion (for otherwiſe it is not to be permitted) he may cauſe one of them take care and charge of his Enſigne, in what accident ſoeuer might fall out during that time: for that thing ought neuer to be left alone or abandoned to a ſlender and looſe guard, which is of ſuch a great importance, whereupon euery mans honor and eſtimation dependeth; wherefore it ought of all to be carefully kept, and well accompanied.</p>
               <p>Note that the <hi>Alfierus,</hi> to defend his Enſigne and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:181245:50"/> at one inſtant, muſt haue in his one hand his drawne ſword, and in the other the Enſigne: which thing is conuenient of him particularly to be performed, when it is time to aſſault the enemies vpon a wall, Trench, Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lade, Bulwarke, Breach, or in any ſtrait paſſage or enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, ſince that with the point of yron of the Enſigne ſtaffe ſmall defence can be made, as well for the weaknes of the ſtaffe, as through the trouble and continuall waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the ſilke which is about it, ſo that in bearing the ſame diſplayed he ought rather to haue regard where he ſhall ſet his foote, than to the top of the ſtaffe, or any other place leſſe neceſſarie, as well thereby to flie affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which in carying thereof is made manifeſt, as alſo to conduct the ſame with more aſſured courage.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, note that the moſt honorable place of the threde or ranke is the right hand, and the ſecond the left hand; which degrees likewiſe be obſerued in all the rankes of other ſoldiers, aſwell as when diuers Enſignes do march togither in one ranke: for amongſt the bands and ſquares of ſoldiers, the flanks do alwaies reſiſt the aſſaults and furie of the enemie; as the ſides which be neereſt to them, be alwaies guarded of thoſe that be moſt practiſed, and the middle part not, only except the firſt and laſt ranke of the ordinance or battaile, where the middeſt is the place of greateſt eſtimation; for the head or backe of the ſquare being aſſaulted, they then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the greateſt furie. And by good reaſon, for this place of the midſt is euer much more broken and endo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged of the enemies armes and force, than any other part: wherefore amongſt expert and valiant ſoldiers, this roome is of greateſt honor, and of moſt eſtimation, as the place that hath greateſt neede of defence, which
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:181245:50"/> being ſubiect to more open and manifeſt perill than the reſt be, is of greateſt dignitie. For Captaines are accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſhew notable and ſingular fauor to that ſoldier, which they prefer to an enterpriſe of perill and danger, ſo that it be capable of iſſue and altogither deſperate.</p>
               <p>Neither is this to be accounted for a maruell; for as this profeſſion is altogither different from others, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the orders, and ceremonies are diuerſly managed, if a man may terme thoſe things ceremonies, which of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie ought with diligence to be gouerned with great care, arte, and induſtry: It behoues the <hi>Alfierus,</hi> whileſt he doth march in ordinance amidſt the band, to go with a graue and ſtately pace, aduiſedly and couragiouſly ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with modeſtie, and without affectation or vaine bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery: neither ought he to bow or decline his body at any time to any perſon, that thereby he may repreſent and maintaine the reputation and excellencie of armes, and the Enſigne before his Prince, chiefe Ruler, Lord Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, Coronell, Captaine, Gouernor &amp;c. As he paſſeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, he ought to abaſe the points and tip of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, or rather with his arme bow downe neere-hand all the ſtaffe of the Enſigne, and ſo much more, by how much he is of greater dignitie and authoritie. In this ſort ſhall he make ſigne of reuerence, and not pull off his cap or hat, neither bend his knee, nor moue any one part of his perſon, thereby to retaine that dignitie due to the Enſigne and his office.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Alfierus</hi> being in ſquare, ranke, or ordinance, with the Enſigne diſplaid, doth change (almoſt neuer) the place where he is planted to march, which is in the midſt of the footmen, as a place moſt ſafe and beſt defended. Therefore thoſe that otherwiſe would vſe it, do ground

               <p>Neither is it expedient to put this officer, which is of ſuch great reſpect, alwaies in hazard, as well for the good qualitie of his perſon, the which we muſt alwaies preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him to be of, as alſo for the office of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance he ſupplies, ſince he doth ſuſtaine the diſplaid En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, wherein the reputation and honor of all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany conſiſts. But at ſuch time as he ſhall march to a Scalade, breach and battery, the valiant <hi>Alfierus</hi> with his Enſigne in one hand, and his ſword in another, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid, ought to enforce himſelfe to be the firſt, and by all meanes to mount vp, to enter amongſt the enemies, and to aduance and inuite the reſt forward, both his infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, companions, and betters: for in effect at ſuch times the particular guiding of the band appertaines to him. Now to the intent that the ſoldiers at the inſtant time of a dangerous enterpriſe, and in a comberſome and peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous time and place, may be invited, and feruently ſtirred vp to follow the Enſigne: He muſt therefore vſe ſuch curteſie to all men, that in all hazards and great exploits, he being beloued of the ſoldiers, may be very much aided and defended by them; whereas otherwiſe they do either ſuffer open ignominie, or danger of death, when as they be either abandoned at the point of extremitie, or traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly ſlaine or wounded by their owne companions and followers, as at the aſſault of <hi>Dalahaui,</hi> and a skirmiſh of brauery at <hi>Louaine,</hi> chanced vnto two ſeuerall Enſigne-bearers
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:181245:51"/> of the Baron of <hi>Sheueran,</hi> Coronell ouer ten En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes of ſhot: therefore ſince he is the ſhadow of the valour and good condition of his Captaine and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, let him be carefull of his dutie.</p>
               <p>The Enſigne-bearer may of his diſcretion and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, eſpying the company trauaile, or follow enemies to their diſcommoditie and perill, looſing the winde, hill, or ground of aduantage, diſordering the aray, may ſtand ſtill, and cauſe the drums and fifes to ſtand and ſound the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, that the company may reſort and come to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, and order the aray by the aduantage of the ground, rather than abide the comming of the enemie.</p>
               <p>He ought alwaies to haue about him, and to lodge where he doth himſelfe, ſo many good drums, as there be hundreths in his band; that at all times he may make Raccolte, and gather his ſoldiers togither, and for ſuch like neceſſarie reſpects.</p>
               <p>He ought neuer craue licence to go to any enterpriſe whatſoeuer, for any deſire he hath to make himſelfe knowne, or to win fame, but ought to remaine ſtedfaſt and firme, when his turne of ſeruice comes, in reſpect of the great charge he doth carry in the manage of the Enſigne.</p>
               <p>It is neceſſarie to haue a horſe for his owne vſe, the which whileſt he marcheth ought to go neere the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, whether he be in ſquare battaile or long march: for by taking his eaſe on horſebacke, he may keep himſelfe continually luſtie and freſh, and therewithall may accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate his cariage, or baggage; as ſome ſoldiers may likewiſe do among the ordinarie cariage, prouided for by the Captaine.</p>
               <p>Note that the Enſigne which he receiued of his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:181245:52"/> muſt by him be reſtored againe at ſuch times as he is diſcharged out of the company; if during the time of his ſeruice, there hath not chanced a battaile, aſſault, or other enterpriſe, wherein the <hi>Alfierus</hi> being preſent, hath made manifeſt apparance, that he hath merited and deſerued the ſame. For in ſuch caſes it is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that he hath wonne and gained the ſame, and not otherwiſe, vnleſſe the Captaine of his free will doth giue it him, which is a very ancient cuſtome, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally amongſt the Italians.</p>
               <p>It is very requiſite the <hi>Alfierus</hi> haue beſides his two Aſſiſtants, a valiant and couragious ſeruant, who is a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed ſoldier, and not a nouice, or yoongling, as ſome very fondly and vnaduiſedly do entertaine now a-dayes, that continually being neere him, as well in the maine ſquare battaile, or elſewhere, to ſecond him with a peece, pike, or target of proofe; and may haue in ſuch a one that entire faith and aſſured credit, that he ſhould haue of a faithfull companion, whom he muſt not keepe, as an abiect ſeruant, but he ought to maintaine him, apparell him, and arme him with conuenient armes of defence; for ſometimes it ſhall fall out in the day of a fought bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile of a whole armie, that thoſe deputed ſeruants may haue the cuſtodie of all the Enſignes in the maine ſquare battaile, and the <hi>Alfierus</hi> of ech company, as men well ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med be placed in the head of the battaile, or in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther principall or neceſſarie places, which are to be gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and defended by practiſed and valiant ſoldiers; as particularly fell out at ſuch time as the <hi>Marqueſs</hi> of <hi>Vaſto,</hi> fought at <hi>Creſola</hi> in <hi>Lombardie</hi> againſt the Frenchmen, which iourney was loſt by the Emperialiſts, although that day they fought valiantly; and beſides in other enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:181245:52"/> ſuch men haue executed gallant ſeruice.</p>
               <p>He muſt alwaies prouide a ſufficient <hi>corps de guard</hi> about his Enſigne, as well by day as night, in what place ſoeuer he ſhall be, although no ſuſpicion were to be had of the enemie, that thereby he may remaine ſafe from all ſudden ſurpriſes, or vnprouided caſualties, and the rather to maintaine the honor and reputation due to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, whereby all ſiniſter inconuenience may be auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the maieſtie and office of the ſame generally well reſpected; eſpecially when time and place of ſuſpect miniſters occaſion. The <hi>Alfierus</hi> muſt march to the guard, either armed with a Curaſe of proofe, or ſome other conuenient garment of defence, being ſtill ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with his ſeruant, who is to carry either target, halberd, peece, or pike, or ſuch weapon as he doth delight in, which at the ſeat of the guard, taking his Enſigne in his hand, he muſt let reſt in the keeping of his ſeruant. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it requiſite in going or marching, that he vnloſe and diſplay the Enſigne, without ſome ſpeciall occaſion, but ought to reſerue the aduancing, and diſplaying of the ſame at full, vntill he come in the ſight of the Cheiftaine or Prince, or in the ſight of the enemie, or other places of ſeruice.</p>
               <p>It is neceſſarie his Enſigne haue certaine ſpeciall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſignes and markes, that it may eaſily be knowne of his ſouldiers, both neere hand and farre off, to the intent that in all exploits, and at vnknowne ſuddaines, his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers may perfitly perceiue the ſame amongſt the other Enſignes, different from the reſt, wherein the Alfierus muſt vſe an exquiſite manage, that by his wiſe and valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous actions without any other mans relation, may be diſcerned his vertuous actions and forward proceedings,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:181245:53"/> which he ought to make apparant by ſome notable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe.</p>
               <p>The Alfierus muſt be a man of good account, of a good race, honeſt and vertuous, braue in apparell, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to honour his office, and continually armed as well when no perill is feared, as in time of danger, to giue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to the reſt of the ſouldiers not to thinke their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour burthenous, but by vſe to make it as familiar to him as his skinne. Finally, he muſt be a man skilfull, hardy, and couragious, of able courage to aduance and beare vp the Enſigne in all extremities, ſecret, ſilent, and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, able often to comfort, animate and encourage the company to take in hand, &amp; maintaine ſuch extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, &amp; enterpriſes, as they are appointed vnto, and neuer to retire, but when of noble policie, the higher Officers commaund the ſame. Vnto this Officer there ſhould be certaine ceremonies vſed in deliuery of the Enſigne, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing it by oath in the preſence of his band, at which time he muſt make vow and profeſſe the ſame rather to be his winding ſheete, and therein to loſe his life, then through his default to loſe the ſame: whereunto euery priuate ſouldier ſhould likewiſe be ſworne, as among the <hi>Romanes</hi> it was vſed, when he was not accounted a ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, but a theefe, or robber, till hee had taken his oath. And therefore their warre was called <hi>Militia Sacrata.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> The office of the Lieutenant of a Companie.</head>
               <p>THat perſon vpon whom any charge doth depend, and doth deſeruedly manage any affaire, muſt frame himſelfe to vſe due diligence, and with dexteritie ſuffer ſuch tedious toile, as in theſe ſerious affaires ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, ſince that charge (as I haue already ſaid) ſignifieth nothing elſe but a burthen of affaires.</p>
               <p>Therefore that a ſouldier may deſeruedly mount vp to this degree of worthy honour and martiall dignitie, he muſt vſe all circumſpect care to performe his office like an expert Lieutenant, that the company be well gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which he muſt accompliſh with a forward and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling minde (though of dutie hee is bound to performe the ſame) aſwell to content the minde of his Captaine, as to augment his owne honour and reputation. He muſt neuer appropriate vnto himſelfe any one point of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, but diligently diſcipher and vnderſtand all things, and make relation thereof to his Captaine, of whom it is neceſſarie he take all his commiſſions and directions. His part is to giue willingly and readily counſell and aduiſe to his Captaine, as often as he is demanded, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe neuer, vnleſſe he ſee that the ſame may doe manifeſt good, or in caſe of preſent perill.</p>
               <p>The Lieutenant ought to carie with him a diligent care of concord, for that particularly the pacification of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords and difference amongſt the ſouldiers of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, appertaines vnto him, which muſt be done without choler or paſſion, and muſt ſtill handle them very indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:181245:54"/> and curteouſly. For his indifferencie, beſides the gaining of him truſtie credite, doth make eaſie the deſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of any difference or diſagreement, and is one point which of neceſſity is moſt conuenient to an honourable Peace-maker, although it be a very difficile thing to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure peace in points of honour, ſpecially amongſt ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that ſtand much vpon their punctos, and for that reſpect is it very hard to vſe a iuſt balance. Therefore in ſuch caſes it is moſt requiſite that euery one of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed, ſhew at the full his entire cauſe, the which is a thing not vulgar, neither of ſmall importance. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Pacifier ought neuer to hang more vpon the one ſide then the other, yet it is conuenient he haue ſome ſmall reſpect to him that is wronged againſt reaſon, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to him that is the vnlawfull worker of the iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. But if he finde any difficultie in reſoluing theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, let him conferre with the Captaine, to the end that he, who is knowne to be the occaſion, and will not agree to an honeſt end, may be immediately diſcharged: but if it be thought good that he remaine to ſerue a time, for the execution of ſome ſpeciall enterpriſe, then the word both of the one and the other ought to be taken, vntill the ſame be performed or the pay paſt, and then may diſcharge him, as is ſaid, to ſhun a greater ſcandale: for to enter into vnquiet quarrelling and diſcord, one e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall with an other, and with one that receiues the like ſtipend, is not the part and qualitie of a ſubiect Souldier, but of a free careleſſe Cutter, and band-Buckler, and of an inſolent and importunate perſon, whoſe nature doth argue in him that his doings tend to an other end, then to become excellent in the honourable exerciſe of armes. Put the caſe that one of them ſhould valiantly ouercome
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:181245:54"/> the other, yet vnto the Captaine doth ariſe no other then want, loſſe, and euill ſatisfaction: for when firſt hee did receiue them into his ſeruice, hee did preſume that they were both of them equally to be eſteemed, men of good credite and behauiour, and that for ſuch they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted and receiued ſtipend. So that quarrelling and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling one the other, as often it falls out in reſolute perſons, or putting him to a diſhonour or open foile: ſuch a one doth not onely depriue the Captaine of a Souldier, but alſo of himſelfe likewiſe: for the law of reaſon doth binde the Captaine not to maintaine an importunate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a malefactour, and an homicide, in one band no leſſe then a well ordered citie: Conſidering it is requiſite and conuenient his Souldiers, rather then to imploy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in ſuch quarrels, ſhould indeauour and aduenture their bodies to ouerthrow and kill the enemie, thereby to procure his owne proper praiſe and peculiar profite. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies prouided, that the occaſion of the warres be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded and publiſhed to be lawfull and honeſt, which eaſily in this reſpect doth remoue all difficulties, whilſt a man doth place himſelfe in the ſeruice of a Prince that is religious, prudent, and iuſt, and that haue expreſſe and lawfull power to leuie armes, and not with thoſe which are of ſmall authoritie, or tiranous Vſurpers of other mens ſtates, and wicked bloud ſuckers.</p>
               <p>Therefore when the Lieutenant cannot by his owne dealings ſupply theſe wants, or pacifie and accord them, in ſuch cauſes he may remit the care thereof vnto his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour and Captaine. And thus let him haue ſpeciall care that by his meanes no quarrels do grow, neither that he ſuffer any faction or diſcention, to take deepe roote, for feare of banding and mutinies.</p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:181245:55"/>
               <p>He ought to haue ſpeciall reſpect that the Corporals and Sergeants be able duly to execute their office with due diligence for the better performance of ſeruice, and perſonally aide them in ſetting the watch.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe, to the intent that the Sergeant perſiſt not ignorantly, or faile in any one point of his office: it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houes the Lieutenant in many particular points to aide him, both in reſpect of his owne credite, and for the generall benefit of the whole band: as in vſing diuers di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, diſciplines, inuentions, putting the band in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ranke, ſquare, in accompanying them to the watch, and in executing ſuch like enterpriſes which commonly are to be performed.</p>
               <p>So ought he likewiſe to delight himſelfe extraordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (beſides the other neceſſary parts of his office) in taking view of the Corps de gard, and the Sentinels of his proper company, to the intent they may remaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually vigilant and ready, and each mans duty duely executed, the martiall lawes read and examined, and a ſolemne ſilence generally maintained.</p>
               <p>He muſt obſerue great affabilitie and fraternitie with the Alfierus, and friendly conſult with him (ſpecially if the Lieutenant doth not manage both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther office, as the Spaniards and other nations doe vſe, and might very well be vſed of vs, if the Generall or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronell thinke good, both for auoiding of emulation and charge of pay) but if they be two particular Officers, and beare diſtinct ſway in the band, then let the Lieutenant be very carefull (as he that is the chiefe) to auoide all ſtomaking and ſtrife that might ariſe betwixt him and the Alfierus, for thereby oftentimes great ſcandales haue falne out, and the diuiſion of the company, a thing aboue
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:181245:55"/> all other to be carefully foreſeene and ſhunned. Hee ought to vſe a gratious geſture, and a curteous entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to all his ſouldiers, countenance euery one ioyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſolicite their cauſes carefully towards the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and the other Officers, as the Treaſurers, Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters, Commiſſaries and ſuch like, yet euer by the Captaines conſent, yea and to the Captaine himſelfe, by whoſe friendly fauour inferiour Officers may be relieued for their pay or other wants. Beſides he ought to giue or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and direction to all the company, diuiding and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting the ſquadres indifferently and diſcretly, to the intent the Corporals and other Officers may be obeyed, and that each enterpriſe may be performed without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply or contradiction.</p>
               <p>It is neceſſarie that he put in euery Squadre an equall number of euery ſort of armes, and that each weapon be ſorted in a readineſſe, to the intent that in what place and time ſoeuer occaſion doth require, euery one of them may to his great aduantage, proceed and front the inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding enemie with a forceable ſtrength.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe it is good ſometimes not to ſuffer a ſquadre or rather a whole Corps de gard to conſiſt of ſouldiers all of one Countrey and nation, but ought rather to bee artificially mixed, and to ſeparate them, thereby to auoid quarrell and generalitie of factions, which by reaſon of their being together may the rather ariſe amongſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts of one natiue Countrie, and that more commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly then if they were ſeparated.</p>
               <p>The Captaine being abſent, the Lieutenant poſſeſſeth the principall and chiefe place, and ought to be obeyed as Captaine Neuertheleſſe in his preſence, it is requiſite he vſe a certaine brotherly friendſhip and familiaritie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:181245:56"/> all, yet that notwithſtanding, he muſt proceede in all things with ſuch modeſtie and grauity, as he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſuch authoritie and reputation, as the office he doth hold, doth moſt worthily inueſt him withall.</p>
               <p>There ought to be in him a reaſonable good knowledge and facilitie in expreſſing his conceit and meaning ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, that the ſouldiers may vnderſtand what they haue to doe, to the intent he may the more eaſily imprint in the hearts and mindes of his Souldiers all ſuch things as hee determines, and that be neceſſarie for the better ſeruice of his Prince, and the benefit of his Countrey and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, whereunto hee ought to apply himſelfe with all poſſible diligence, ſince that of the Prince he is liberally paid, hath his being of his Countrey, and is diligently obeyed of his Band, where he ſwaies his preſent office and charge, which is truely of great credit and no leſſe commoditie.</p>
               <p>Let him prouide himſelfe of a horſe to beare him, to the intent he may be luſty and freſh in all enterpriſes, and that he may continually take the view and diligently ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey the order which they are to keepe in marching, or in making Alta, and at all other times beſides in what en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe ſoeuer.</p>
               <p>He muſt take order that his baggage or carriage, which ought to be as little as may be (which rule the common Souldiers ought likewiſe obſerue) be borne and conuaide amongſt the common cariage, which the Captaine hath ordained and prouided for the vſe of the whole band.</p>
               <p>He muſt take diligent care to the redeeming of preſt or lent money, which the Captaine ſhall make according to occaſion or neede amongſt the company, and to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute the ſame conueniently amongſt the Souldiers, and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:181245:56"/> thereof to render and yeeld good account to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, by doing whereof he ſhall pleaſure the Souldiers much, in which time of pay, he hath very good oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie to put the Souldiers in minde, and to teach them to proceed in well doing, and to deſiſt from euill.</p>
               <p>It appertaines generally to euery Lieutenant of a band to be of great experience and ripeneſſe of ſeruice, whoſe authoritie in the abſence of the Captaine (as partly I touched before) extendeth to examine, trie, reforme, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, and amend any offence committed within the band, and alſo day and night to bring the company with the Enſigne to the place of aſſembly, there in order traine and exerciſe the ſame, as to the neceſſity of ſeruice doth appertaine, and being commanded by the higher powers to march towards the enemie, muſt encounter and fight with them, as if the Captaine were in preſence, who vpon impediment, muſt ſometimes be abſent.</p>
               <p>Finally, it appertaines to the Lieutenant to watch, ward, approach, conduct, aduance againſt the enemies, and to encounter, animate, comfort, and alſo to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the company by word and deed as need ſerueth: to retire continually maintaining skirmiſh, vntill he haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered ſome place of ſafegard.</p>

               <p>He muſt alwaies of neceſſitie haue more than one ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, and ought to apparell him in gallant order: theſe are to be neere his elbow to follow him with his armes. He ought alwaies to lodge himſelfe as neere as is poſſible, to the lodging of his Colonell or Captaine, to the intent
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:181245:58"/> that either armed, or without armes, he may alwayes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the cauſe doth require, be about his perſon, either on horſeback or on foot; for that the principall guard of this ſingular perſonage, that is to ſay, the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell or Captaine, doth conſiſt in the diligence and cuſtody of the Caualliers of <hi>S. George</hi> his ſquadrons: for ſo I will be bold to call them, though the title be to be varied. Theſe things notwithſtanding, day and night when it fals to his lot, or that he ſhall be commanded by his Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to watch, he muſt diſpoſe himſelfe to be able to make particular guard, and that after a moſt exquiſite order: wherein he muſt haue ſpeciall care (without making refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall at any time) to performe that which ſhall be appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him by his Corporall, or by any other that ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in the name of his Colonell or Captaine. His office in time of watch, for the moſt part, conſiſts in going the Round, ſearching the watch, keeping good order in the Corps of Guard, in being a Coadiutor to the officer that guides the company, or rules the watch, and is for the moſt part exempted from ſtanding Sentinell, and ſuch like duties of a common ſoldier, vnleſſe great neceſſitie or ſpeciall ſeruice conſtraine. It appertaines to him to haue good experience in going the Round, that in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the ſame, he may diſcreetly gouerne in the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of the watch, called the <hi>Sopraguardia:</hi> for in this point doth very much conſiſt the prouident good order and forme that is to be obſerued, in auoyding the ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems, ſurpriſes, ſallies, and deceits of the enemie. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching neere to the Sentinell, he muſt giue eye and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent regard in what order and ſort he doth finde him vigilant, how ready he is in demanding and taking the word, and after comming neerer him, he muſt examine
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:181245:58"/> all that hath paſſed or fallen out whileſt he hath bin in Sentinell, and the order he doth obſerue, and what hath bin appointed him to doe: the which if it be good he muſt confirme, and when he doth finde it to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, he muſt reherſe and refer the ſame to the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the Sentinell, that he may vſe diligent redreſſe.</p>
               <p>Arriuing in any Corps de guard, he muſt aboue all things aduertiſe them, that they alwaies keepe fire light for the neceſſarie commoditie of the Harquebuſiers, and for light in the night, taking order with the ſoldiers that they and their armes may remaine in a forcible readines: through which his good inſtruction, there may grow to be no want, and ſo conſequently he muſt in like caſes proceed with like prouident diligence.</p>
               <p>After this he muſt with great conſideration and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie, examine euery particular thing, carrying a minde with himſelfe to continue and increaſe the ſame from better to better, and both in himſelfe and to them vſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie aduertiſements, and in ſuch ſort ſhall he paſſe through all the Corps de guards, and Sentinels.</p>
               <p>If it chance him to incounter another <hi>Sopraguardia</hi> or Round, to ſhun the occaſion of dangerous difference, which ſometimes is accuſtomed to follow: or for po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, in fearing to giue the watch-word to him that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely comes to rob the ſame, that comming from the enemy ſecretly, counterfeits the Sentinell, or by ſome other practiſe, as it ſometimes hath cauſed damage to the grieuous loſſe and totall preiudice of the Armie: to preuent ſuch inconuenience, let that <hi>Sopraguardia</hi> which ſhall be neereſt to the next adioyning Sentinell, turne backe, giuing the word after a due accuſtomed ſort vnto the ſaid Sentinell, to the intent the foreſaid <hi>Sopraguardia</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:181245:59"/> may do the like, and when they are of accord, euery one may follow his owne path; but if otherwiſe they doe diſagree, the deceit remaines diſcouered, not only in that counterfeit Round, but alſo in the fained Sentinell, whom the <hi>Sopraguardia</hi> muſt examine, and demand at his hand ſome ſpeciall counterſigne or double word, that thereby he may know him for an aſſured friend, or finde him an enemy or negligent perſon, the which of all men is very well knowne to merit ſharpe and extreame cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement, which at no time, ſo neere as is poſſible, is to be omitted.</p>
               <p>This former rule is to be obſerued of thoſe ſoldiers that be of one ſelfe nation: but when the Rounds or Sopraguards be many and of ſundry Nations, and the Corps of guards likewiſe; then the Sopraguard com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into a quarter that is ſtranger vnto him, is bound to giue the word to the Sopraguard of that nation, and of that quarter; ſo that by ſuch meanes as well the ſuſpition of deceit, as the occaſion of diſcord ſhall be auoyded.</p>
               <p>And if in caſe the ſaid ordinarie Round or Sopra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, do incounter in their owne quarter, with the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, thoſe that be ordinary ſhall indeuour them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to take the word of thoſe that be extraordinarie: for ſo it is conuenient, and moſt conformable to that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der before-ſaid, wherein I haue ſet downe what is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie for a Sopraguard or Round to do in a ſtrange quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And for that it is requiſite, as I haue already touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Caualliers be alwaies about the perſon of his chiefe Captaine, without either being bound to Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derd, Guidon, or other Enſigne whatſoeuer, he muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour himſelfe, when any enterpriſe or warlike affaires is committed to his charge, to be apt and ready to vſe
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:181245:59"/> practiſed experience in directing and guiding a skirmiſh, in taking the view of a battery, in diſcouering of the enemy, in marching or making Alta, in Paſſa parde in the valiant repulſe of a ſodaine inuading enemie by <hi>Bawl en bouche,</hi> in taking view of the ſituation of a place, in gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a Roade, or troupe of horſemen, in giuing alarme to the enemie, in plucking aduertiſements from the enemy, in placing Imbaſcades, in giuing Canvaſadoes, and to know very well how to execute with ſound iudgement theſe and ſuch like important affaires, the which for the moſt part appertaine to the Caualliers of this Squadron to performe. As likewiſe it hath bin the cuſtome to giue them the charge for to plant <hi>Gabiones</hi> for the defence of the Artillery, to batter and endomage the walles, the trenches, the lodgings, and the enemies Squadrons.</p>
               <p>Let him remember when he hath bin at any exploit, to bring backe againe into his quarter, thoſe ſoldiers he hath led forth to any enterpriſe, vnited and in ranke, marching togither behind him, and neuer ſuffer them to returne diſbanded one by one out of order, which is an occaſion of great confuſion, and brings but ſmall reputation to the Captaine and conductor of them.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, it is very neceſſarie he know how to make a roade and deſtroy the enemies country; the which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe doth oftentimes appertaine to him to performe: in which exploit he muſt beware aboue all things, that no ſoldier in thoſe enterpriſes diſperſe or diſband them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but with an aſſured good order, for the moſt part conformable to my following diſcourſe, wherein I ſet downe directions, how to conduct ſoldiers to the skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh: and particularly where I declare that he ought to keepe and maintaine for his people the ſtrongeſt place
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:181245:60"/> of ſituation, wherein he muſt skirmiſh; for that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſoldiers being in diſorder, wearied and laden with ſpoile, may be eaſily put to flight, broken and oppreſſed of the enemies, vnleſſe they be ſeconded or ſhaded by ſome forceable ſuccour.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe it likewiſe moſt neceſſarie, that he indeuour himſelfe to be apt and ſufficient at all times, and in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to ſollicite and negotiate for his Prince or Chieftaine, any cauſe of what weight or moment ſoeuer, conſidering that moſt men are not fit to attempt the performance of ſuch doubtfull and difficile cauſes: for although many make great eſtimation of themſelues, and preſume much by their daily reading and Theoricke of thoſe weighty affaires, yet do they want and come far ſhort of that bold and ready practiſe, which plainely appeares, that the worthy profeſſors of Armes poſſeſſe; and ſpecially in the preſence of great Princes, whoſe maieſtie and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for the moſt part, doth make cold and bring out of countenance the hotteſt &amp; moſt reſolute determination: as <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> before <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedone</hi> made apparent, when he was not able to pronounce three words of a long premeditated Oration, in behalfe of the <hi>Athenians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This worthy Gentleman of a band, this Cauallier of <hi>S. Georges</hi> ſquadre, and likewiſe all other profeſſors of warlike armes, ought to carry in minde, that of him and his equals the exerciſe of Armes is to be applied, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to practiſe the ſame, to the intent he be not for want of knowledge deſpiſed of others; and not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly to deſpiſe them that deſerue due commendations, but rather to carry and vſe the countenance of authoritie to thoſe perſons that merit not to beare ſway and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, than towards forward ſoldiers: Yet for all
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:181245:60"/> that towards the reſt in ſome other reſpects, he ought to gratifie them and helpe them to his power, and ſo cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly winne the goodwils and freindly fauour of all ſouldiers his equals, to inſtruct and courteouſly to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh euery Souldier priuately and apart, what appertaines to his dutie. This Caualliere muſt be able alſo to traine ſouldiers, to make them march in orderly proportions, to caſt them in ringes, eſſes, ſnailes, hearſes, ſquadres, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue and giue charge, to faine skirmiſhes, onſets, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traites, and how to order any number of ſouldiers, from a hundreth to fiue hundreth, for ſo many may be in a Band, and vnder one Enſigne, as the <hi>Swizers</hi> and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines</hi> yet vſe at this day, and as in former ages our Countrimen haue vſed, which in ſome reſpects may paſſe without reprehenſion. If a Captaine be diſpoſed to haue ſo many vnder his Enſigne, when he is not able to bring the number vnto a whole Colloniſhip, together with the knowledge of the order how to traine, he muſt indeauour himſelfe to be perfit in drawing platformes, in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematikes, in the martiall Lawes, in beſieging of townes, batteries, mines, and each thing elſe belonging to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall diſcipline.</p>
               <p>Let this worthy Cauallier of <hi>Saint Georges</hi> ſquadre haue then before his eyes ſuch like precepts, and manage of martiall affaires, that he may encreaſe his owne credit, winne his countrey fame, fauour of his Prince, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his houſe and friends, rather then for the regard of riches, ſtately houſes, liuings, and ſuch like, but rather preferre prudent policie, courage, valour and approued experience before ſuch baſe benefits, whereby hee may attaine to the Lawrell crowne, wherewith diuers mighty Conquerors haue their heads adorned: that hee may be
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:181245:61"/> an example to the reproach of ſuch as lewdly ſpend their daies in idleneſſe, prodigalitie, luſt and obloquie.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> The office of a Captaine which hath the guiding of a Band of men.</head>
               <p>THat perſon which hath the charge to gouerne other men, ſpecially in matters of weight and of great importance, the liues of men being committed to his hands, vnder whoſe conduct if any quaile through raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or want of knowledge, he is bound to render ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count before God: and therefore he ought to be of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table capacitie, experience, and exemplar in all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and enterpriſes, ſince it is a generall note that the eyes of all thoſe that be ſubiects, be turned towards their principall head and chiefe, in whom as it were in a glaſſe, they retaine an aſſured hope to behold moſt ready rules and perfit examples, whereby they may guide and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne themſelues.</p>
               <p>In this particular charge of a Captaine, the qualitie of his Officers, make almoſt a manifeſt ſhew of his valour and experience: Therefore like an old and expert Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, as one that hath paſt through all thoſe degrees and offices ſet downe in my two former bookes, he muſt vſe a circumſpect care in leuying and making choiſe of his company, that is, to make election of a politike and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed Lieutenant, of a couragious Alfierus, of a carefull Sergeant, of gallant and valiant Caualliers of his ſquadre, of valiant Corporals, of a diligent Chancellour, Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:181245:61"/> or Clarke of the Band, of a faithfull Furrier or Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binger, being of good iudgement and conſideration, and of a Surgion prouided of all things neceſſarie to miniſter according to his arte. But aboue all things let him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide to retaine in his Band a Preacher, or ſuch a perſon which may take care to miniſter the Communion to the Souldiers, and ſpecially to roote obedience in their hearts: who likewiſe euery day may celebrate diuine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, which euen from the beginning hath beene vſed of the Church. And finally muſt haue for euery hundreth a practiſed Drummer of good vnderſtanding.</p>
               <p>When he hath gathered and vnited his companie, the whole Band being preſent, his Miniſter muſt deuoutly read certaine praiers, and afterward the Enſigne ſhall be publikely placed in the hands, and recommended to the cuſtodie of the Alfierus, and as in my former diſcourſe of this point, command him to haue as much care there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as of his proper life, honour and credite, which hee ought couragiouſly to aduance and diſplay, to prefer his party in a rightfull quarrell, according to my ſpeech where I ſet downe his duty. This done he muſt priuate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make election amongſt his chiefeſt Souldiers of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Caualliers or Lancia Spezzata, that is to ſay, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of his Band, as may amount to the number of two out of euery ſquadre. Some nations vſe 50. to a ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre, as the Suitzers and Germaines, ſome others leſſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their diſcretion: but in my opinion 25. is a more conuenient number, both for that the Corporall may the more often and with greater diligent care in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct and ſee to his charge, then if they were 50. Beſides 25. ſouldiers diuided into 5. rankes makes a iuſt ſquare, ſo that by the ſame account 300. may containe 12. ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dres,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:181245:62"/> and euery one haue a Corporall of the ſame num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: whereof 10. Corporalls haue the leading of mixt weapons, the 11. charge ouer the Halberdiers, and the 12. to conſiſt of Gentlemen, old and expert Souldiers, amongſt whom the targets of proofe ought to be in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. The Captaine at the ſame time, when he appoints his Enſigne, muſt likewiſe ſolemnly conſtitute and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme a Corporall ouer the Caualliers of his ſquadre, which he may entitle of Saint <hi>George,</hi> and enroll their names by this title, the Corporall and Caualliers of of <hi>S. George</hi> his ſquadre. He may inueſt and beſtow vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Corporall a ſcarfe of red and white ſarſnet, and a Medall or iewell of gold or ſiluer double gilt, wherein the portrature of <hi>S. George</hi> is liuely wrought, to hang a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his necke, at his ſcarfe or otherwiſe: and moreouer to him and all the reſt of the ſquadre he may giue a little Phane or Penon of ſilke vpon a wire, whereof the Croſſe muſt be of red, and the reſt of the ſquare white, the other part of the ſarſenet of the Captaines coulors, or with what words, or deuiſe therein ſhall pleaſe him beſt: They muſt weare this behind, either vpon their burganets, or vpon their hats if they will in a plume of red and white feathers, ſpecially in all enterpriſes and warlike attempts: Beſides this vpon their caſſockes or mandillions towards their right breſt a red croſſe of veluet, ſatten or ſcarlet, imbrothered or comely ſtitched, that they may appeare manifeſtly and be knowne from the reſt of the Souldiers, like worthy Guides and Leaders, whoſe courage and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour may incite others to aſcend to their dignitie and degree.</p>
               <p>They muſt ſolemnly promiſe, vow and ſweare to their poſſibilitie, not onely to be the firſt to force the breach of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:181245:62"/> a battered towne, trench, or fortreſſe, to giue the firſt cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious onſet vpon the maine battaile, or the enemies ſquadrons, to peirce a paſſage, and gallantly guide the Souldiers to the skirmiſh, to ſuddaine ſallies, ſurpriſes, eſcalados, canuaſados, and ſuch like, but alſo to obſerue, maintaine, and inſtruct the ignorant in all militarie dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, obſeruations, and martiall lawes of the field.</p>
               <p>In reſpect hereof thoſe that be Caualliers and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of this ſquadre, muſt be intertained with a ſtipend and greater pay then the common Souldier, and with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther notable ſignes of manifeſt difference, by reaſon they either are or ought to be the beſt and moſt practiſed Souldiers in his whole band: for this word Lancia ſpez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zata amongſt the <hi>Italians,</hi> is of no other ſignification, then a tried experience in the warres. To which Caual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers he may freely and faithfully with great confidence and truſt, commit the charge of any office in his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie that is vacant, or the performance of any other enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe or accident, and may if he will tearme them extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Lieutenants, which he muſt alwaies haue about him vpon any ſodaine to execute his commandement, and ſupply other offices when time ſhall ſerue.</p>
               <p>A Captaine ought to haue ſpeciall and particular knowledge of all thoſe things that appertaine to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Lieutenant, and the office of an Alfierus, which if he thinke good he may linke both in one, for amongſt diuers nations now a daies, one man commonly ſupplies both their offices.</p>

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:181245:63"/> dutie of euery particular and common Souldier, that he may preſently redreſſe any thing amiſſe, and vpon any new accident to inſtruct them either in marching, encamping, or fighting, ſo that he may be able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them, according as time, place, and reaſon doth require, without contradiction or appointing that to be done of one Officer, which ought to be done of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: or that he doth command them to doe things not conuenient, and much leſſe that which is not lawfull or not honourable. Which order of proceeding doth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much diſpleaſe and bring men of warre in miſlike of ſuch vndirect dealings. Since the principall point and practiſe whereunto their exerciſe in armes doth tend, is to attaine reputation, honour, and credite, he muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually court his Collonell and Cheiftaine, forcing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be one of the firſt that doth ſalute him in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and of the laſt to depart from him in the euening, that thereby hee may be ſufficiently inſtructed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in euery particular act and practiſe, which is to be put in execution, touching the performance of any enterpriſe or warlike act, ſince that in thoſe caſes a wary man may beſt take hold of occaſion, whereof he ought to make triall in time of warre, the which he is likewiſe to accompliſh, aſwell for the ſeruice of his cheife and Prince, as alſo for his owne ſatisfaction, and the honour, benefit, and reputation of his Souldiers.</p>
               <p>Let him in ſome ſort prouide with as much aduantage and commodity as he can, that his ſouldiers baggage be alwaies conducted from place to place, alwaies prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſuperfluitie, and in long voiages their corſlets and armes of heauie burthen: prouided that he march not in ſuſpected places, and in the enemies countrie, but not otherwiſe.</p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:181245:63"/>
               <p>Let him take order that his Souldiers be light in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, ſo that it be warme, and haue as little baggage and otherwiſe loaden as may be, to the intent they may vſe all their diligence about their weapons, and not to hale backe for feare of looſing the ſame, but rather haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the warie keeping of their armes, and that they may rather be more bent and determined to fight, in hope of gaine and honour, then ſuſpected thorough the doubt of looſing that which they already poſſeſſe.</p>
               <p>He muſt not be couetous, neither retaine one penie of pay from his Souldiers, but rather diſtribute amongſt them, all the aduantages, dead paies, and capiſoldi: to the intent they may be well paied and rewarded which merite the ſame, ſo ſhall he gaine honour and make them aſſured in perillous ſeruice.</p>
               <p>Let him reſtraine ſouldiers from hauing horſes, thereby to auoide confuſion, for that commonly euery one muſt march about the Enſigne, to the intent the rankes be not broken and diſturbed by horſes: And that Souldiers be not occupied in going abroad for forrage for their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as of neceſſitie they muſt, which is proper to Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and not to footmen, but onely thoſe which are to be permitted with the Lieutenant, the Alfierus, and ſome of the Caualliers of <hi>Saint Georges</hi> ſquadre, that are Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of greateſt experience, for that they may ſerue in ſteed and place of light horſemen, to view, diſcouer, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and carie a meſſage or commandement with great ſpeed, when and where need doth require.</p>
               <p>It is neceſſary for him to haue ſome knowledge and ſight in making bulwarkes, trenches, platformes, skon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, fortreſſes, and ſuch like, and to know the nature and qualitie of them, aſwell that with aduantage he may bee
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:181245:64"/> able to know how to aſſault, as alſo to make them with facilitie, in times and places moſt neceſſarie: which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and Art, is particularly conuenient for him, conſidering the defence of men of warre in the field, for the moſt part conſiſts aſwell in trenches, bulwarkes, and perfect platformes, as in good and well gouerned ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre and in maine battaile.</p>
               <p>He muſt haue with him a paire of lanthornes for the campe, ſome creſſets, linkes, or torches that blow not out with the winde, and ſuch like to vſe in the night, and in ſtormes and tempeſts for ſeruice of the company, as in roundes, alarmes &amp;c. And for his proper commoditie and ornament a pauillion or tent of ſufficient capacitie, veſſels to accommodate his victuals, and furniment for the fire and kitchin, of ſmall weight and diſturbance in cariage, and certaine houſhold ſtuffe neceſſarie for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and his traine, to the intent he may ſo neere as is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible commodiouſly make ſupplie to the continuation of things requiſite for victuals. He ought alwaies to lodge with his Band, and remaine with the ſame both in good and euill, and continually ſhew himſelfe louing and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and take ſuch part as the Souldiers doe: for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, taking his eaſe, and ſuffering them to be lodged or fedde miſerably, breedeth him hatred or contempt.</p>
               <p>Neither ought hee to ſhunne toile and trauaile, but carefully take delight and liking to be alwaies the firſt, that with prouident prudence doth lay his hand to any worke, or performe any enterpriſe which is conuenient to be done: for that for the moſt part the rude ſtubborne multitude of Souldiers is not conſtrained and forced ſo much, to doe his dutie by compulſion, as they be volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie moued thereunto through ſhame, and a reuerent
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:181245:64"/> reſpect they haue to the example of their Superiour. Neither let the practiſe of the ſame be painefull vnto him, for that to liue at eaſe and to be curious of his owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious being, and ſuffer his Souldiers taſt the toiles of trauaile, is rather the order of a delicate Prince, then of a carefull and couragious Captaine.</p>
               <p>Let him not faile euery night that he is of the watch, to ſend his Sergeant to take the word ſecretly of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant maior, (wherewith the watch of that night ought to be gouerned) or of ſome other that ſhall be appointed to giue it, which hee muſt vſe wiſely and warily, ſince that negligence in like caſes may be the ruine of him and his company, and conſequently of a whole armie. Hee muſt haue tried experience, and full practiſe in all the points noted of me in my firſt booke, and be perfit in the conduct of martiall affaires, that with great facilitie hee may be able to know, and with great aduiſe to deale in all the particulars belonging to all the degrees of ſouldiers vnder his eſtate, and of leſſe eſtimation then a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>
               <p>It behoues him to carie a valiant and couragious heart, that vpon all ſuddaines he may be able to execute all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes, and that hauing ouer-viewed, ordered and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed thoſe things that be neceſſary, he may be able to execute the ſame with ſuch prompt and ready dexteritie, as appertaines to the terrible and bloudy accidents of armes. And although there be very few who haue ſuch happy ſucceſſe, as they may be accounted fortunate and politike both together: Neuertheleſſe it is requiſite he be prudent, and diſcipher and looke before hand into ſuch things as are like to fall out, that he may with diſcreete modeſty vſe either good or euill fortune, whether ſoeuer
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:181245:65"/> ſhall ariſe: for the life of man is to be compared to the play at Tables, in the which the player may deſire and deuiſe which is the beſt caſt, but yet which way ſoeuer the dice turne, either good or euill, he ought with as great diſcretion and arte as he can, accommodate himſelfe and ſerue his turne withall. He ſhould poſſeſſe and be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with a noble minde, that he may alwaies haue the ſame inclined to diſcreet liberalitie, and not to nigardly couetouſnes, by which vice we ſee many incurre and fall into moſt opprobrious chances, into treaſons and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious rebellions, which are men worthy of moſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full corrections.</p>
               <p>I iudge it likewiſe very neceſſarie for him to be elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, ſince that qualitie hath great efficacie in perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of mens mindes, which oftentimes haue much need to be wakened and pricked forward with a ſpurre, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in thoſe terrible accidents that fall out in the exerciſe of armes, which in painfull perilous actions would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe languiſh, faint, and become fearefull. Therefore let the loue towards God, the care of their Country, their preſent perill, the example of magnanimitie in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, the quarrell, cauſe, and benefits to ſoule &amp; body, be meanes to make them valiantly accompliſh their acts. He ought neuer to make conference, concerning that which he is to put in execution, neither of any one thoght imagination, or inuention appertaining to the ſtate of thoſe warlike attempts and affaires, but with thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, of whom he may aſſuredly reſerue faithfull and friendly counſell; for that the importance of ſuch and ſo great dealings, ought euer to be had in ſuſpition of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie. Therefore a wiſe and carefull man will euer haue a warie and iealous eye ouer ſuch weighty affaires.</p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:181245:65"/>
               <p>Now the order for him to puniſh his ſoldiers in caſes wherein they are not guilty of death, I thinke the moſt important puniſhment which appertaines to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to giue them, is openly amidſt the whole company and band, ſhamefully to diſarme them, to take away their money and chiefeſt garments, and ſo to baniſh them and ſend them packing: for to put them to death, or furiou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly to beat them, belongs to the office of the Maſter of the Campe and Marſhall of the field, and not to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine; for if he ſhould beat his ſoldiers, he ſhould make himſelfe hated and embaſe himſelfe, and bring his ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers either to become mutinous or abiects. Note, that it is not ſufficient onely for a Captaine to haue ordained his Company diſcreetly, and therein to haue great numbers of good men, which is to ſay, in warlike affaires valiant men: but aboue all things it is very neceſſarie when he ſhall come to blowes and fight, he ſhould aduenture and performe the ſame to his manifeſt aduantage, or elſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained thereunto by pure neceſſitie, although he ought to flie the laſt ſo much as he is able, obſeruing this for a generall rule, not to fight either by chance, either for pleaſure, or for ambition, as many times we ſee done by raſh and ambitious Chiefes and Captaines.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, he muſt worke in ſuch ſort, that his ſoldiers haue very good occaſion and apt means to win the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and that they be freſh and luſtie, to the intent that in fighting they may ouercome: for without theſe and like aduertiſements by tempting fortune, men for the moſt part both looſe, and are ouerthrowne.</p>
               <p>It is very conuenient he procure the hauing of an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and autentike Patent of his Colonell, with as large words of fauour as may be, wherein muſt be declared at
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:181245:66"/> the inſtance and appointment of what Prince the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made, and ſo with modeſtie and prudence he ſhall vſe the authoritie that is giuen him, but neuertheleſſe there, as it behoues him ſo to doe.</p>
               <p>It is not requiſite that in all places he ſuffer his Enſigne to be diſplayed; the manner and doing whereof ſhewes force and authoritie, the which many times is not to be vſed, neither in each place: when a man is inferior to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he ought to vſe great dexteritie and modeſtie, which euer fals out both to be commodious and commendable.</p>
               <p>And moreouer according to the order of <hi>Paſſa parole,</hi> of aduertiſements from mouth to mouth, he ought euer to obſerue a ſilent and aſſured plaine information to his whole band, whereby they may vpon the ſodaine alter aray, make <hi>alta,</hi> march ſlow or faſt, cloſe or in wide ranks, or prepare their peece, match and bullet for a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine Alarme, inuaſion, skirmiſh, or defence.</p>
               <p>A Captaine that muſt leuie a band is to make his ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and choiſe of his officers and ſoldiers, not only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued and ſufficiently experienced, but alſo vſe ſuch ſpeedy march in his expedition and iourney, that he may ioyne his company to the reſt of the Armie, at or before the appointed day and place.</p>
               <p>When he may march by land with his company, let him neuer deſire to goe by ſea, hoping to ſpare coſt and ſhorten time; for by becomming ſubiect to the indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the winde, either through long abode, or ſome accident by ſhipwrack or tempeſts, there hath riſen many times great diſturbance and ruine without remedie, ſince by this defect many good occaſions, and of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance haue bin loſt and made fruſtrate.</p>
               <p>He ought neuer to take iourney in hand without a
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:181245:66"/> guide, the which he muſt procure to be giuen him by the Chiefe that doth command him, to the intent he may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies remaine excuſed and faultleſſe from thoſe errors, that by ſuch defects may or do commonly ariſe; which diligence is not onely particularly to be vſed, when any iourney of ſmall length is to be guided, but if any long iourney is to be made (not being able to do better) he muſt circumſpectly haue him alwaies by his ſide, neither ought to haue him ſlip away from him or abſent, ſince that euery ſmall error or going out of the way in a iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and marching, doth diſpleaſe ſoldiers and warlike perſons, and yeelds leſſe reputation to the Captaine, who ought alwaies to march with them, and to prouide and procure through his authoritie all things neceſſarie, with the greateſt fauour and aduantage poſſible.</p>
               <p>He ought alwaies to keepe his ſoldiers exerciſed, by often view and muſter of them, marching ſometimes along in rankes by 3.5.7. and 9. &amp;c. in a ranke: ſometime in trayning them in Rings, Eſſes, Dees, Battailes, Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons, turning one rank through an other, in leading them to skirmiſh, &amp; in ſuch ſort practiſe them daily. And alſo he muſt cauſe his ſoldiers to ſhoot vollees of ſhot, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times all at once, ſometimes by rankes, and ſometimes mixed: the which vollees vpon the ſigne or ſound of drum, or word of mouth by the Captaine muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed with celeritie, and cloſely togither and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly, and not out of diſorder or by peeces, a great while one after another, but vpon their diſcharge, ioyntly togither; without rumor, noiſe or tumult they muſt all charge againe, and vpon a ſigne giuen by the Captaine, giue a freſh vollee &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:181245:67"/>
               <p>He muſt likewiſe delight to ſee them well armed with all ſorts of armes, euery one according to the weapon he beares: and ſometimes likewiſe exerciſe them in run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, leaping, wraſtling, throwing the barre, and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily cauſe them to be wakened in the morning betimes, charging the drums to ſtrike the Diana throughout the whole quarter.</p>
               <p>A Captaine may at all times accompanie his band with the ſound of drum and fife, which muſt giue order to their continuall march, and directs all their other enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes, vnleſſe to accompany priſoners, to entrench, make plaine the way, to make and carry fagots, baskets, or ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bions from the wood, and ſuch like ſeruile and peſantly ſeruice, hardly digeſted of honorable ſoldiers.</p>
               <p>He to the intent he may be both loued and obeyed of his ſoldiers, muſt apply himſelf to be prouident and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litike in pacifying diſcords, and all ſuch difference as ſhall ariſe amongſt them, wherein if he finde any obſtinate, ſo ſoone as he hath performed his indeuour, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they will not agree and become friands, ſo ſoone as their pay is ended, he ought to diſcharge them. In times paſt it hath bin vſed of notable Colonels to permit the combat, and cauſe them to fight it out, thereby to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh their obſtination, to bridle their furie, and giue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table example to the reſt: the which order although it hath bin tryed to auaile very much for their good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, yet it is not to be vſed amongſt Chriſtians, Councells of Diuines hauing forbidden the ſame; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to feare the parties he faigne that the ſame ſhall be performed of them to the vttermoſt, and at the ioyning in fight to cauſe them ſtay, and take other order of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, except they accord, and to diſcharge them.</p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:181245:67"/>
               <p>A Captaine ought to vſe all art and induſtry to invade, endomage, and ouerthrow the enemie, ſpecially infidels: and aboue all things to be franke of minde, and to feare nothing but diſhoneſt fame: likewiſe that he purchaſe authoritie amongſt his ſoldiers by meanes of vertue and valour; let him procure by practiſe and effectuall expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience to be accounted a wiſe and a worthy valiant Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, rather than to beare the name of a ſimple, weake, and vndiſcreet Colonell: for the name of a Captaine is a type and title of ſpeciall honor.</p>
               <p>He muſt likewiſe in reſpect of a certaine inward deſire of emulation, not carie a baſe and abiect minde, but ſtill aſpiring with great ſubtiltie, by good inuention and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, of a firme and faithfull diſpoſition, and neuer ſubiect to forgetfulnes, to the intent he may retaine in memory thoſe things that be well done, and all commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable enterpriſes, the which do marueilouſly and incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly delight and feede mens mindes and diſpoſitions.</p>
               <p>A Captaine muſt euer take care that his whole charge be ſtill furniſhed with men, armour, weapons and muniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with all things needfull, and diſtributed at conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent times.</p>
               <p>He muſt ſuffer none through idleneſſe to neglect his armour, weapons and other furniture, whereby he ſhall grow vnready to ſeruice at neede, but giue his officers commandment circumſpectly to looke to the ſame.</p>
               <p>Soldiers ſhould be prohibited from ouer-much liberty, neither to vſe whore-hunting, drunkenneſſe, common ſwearing, quarrelling, fighting, couſening, or ſuch like, but ſpeedy correction to be vſed.</p>
               <p>Prouiſion of victuals, armour &amp; munition being made, it muſt diſcreetly be vſed in due time by victuallers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:181245:68"/> and to be diſtributed vnto the ſoldiers, and to ſee that the victuallers and other artificers, lending vnto ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers vpon their credit at neede, vntill their pay day, may be truely ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>If any ſoldiers be taken priſoners, to be ranſomed home in due time, that his bands remaine not vnfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</p>
               <p>Diuers points of ſeruice are committed to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, wherein great diſcretion and ſeruice is to be vſed, as in a Conuoy, Canuiſado, Ambuſh, Skirmiſh, Approch, Aſſault, retreit, ſurpriſe, paſſage of riuers, ſtreights, ſodaine fortifications, diſcoueries, &amp;c. As in theſe and ſuch like occurrences, it is neceſſarie to vſe the aduiſe of expert ſoldiers, whoſe opinions are worthy to be obſerued, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying and rewarding them according to the value of their counſels. So likewiſe a Captaine muſt ſometimes proue, and circumſpectly try by fained pretences, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that he meanes to performe certaine exploits, and will march to ſome place, nothing intending the ſame, to the intent to diſcipher thoſe that be buſie-bodies, raſh and vnſecret in counſell, and ſuch as preſume without knowledge or experience; afterward reuealing the ſame, may try the truth and puniſh the offenders, as to his dutie and office is conuenient.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> The Office of a Colonell.</head>
               <p>A Valiant and worthy Colonell, after he hath a lawfull diſpatch of his Prince, and hath obtained his patent and preſt money, to conduct that number of ſoldiers his
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:181245:68"/> charge and expedition ſhall containe, with all conuenient diligence, and according as he is appointed, he muſt make election of as many Captaines as be needfull, diſtributing to euery one 300 for a band, which number is of moſt conuenient quantitie: for by reducing companies to a leſſe number, as in our time is vſed, ſpecially amongſt the Spaniards and Italians, and followed by the French and Engliſh, they may rather carry the name of Lieutenants and Centurions, than beare the title of Captaines. Beſides a band being made of a ſmall number, the Treaſurers conſume much more money amongſt the great ſtore of officers, the which ought to be by all meanes poſſible auoyded of a politike Generall, and of a prudent Prince, to auoide extraordinarie expence and confuſion, which doth eaſily ariſe amongſt the multitude of officers.</p>
               <p>He muſt be prouident to entertaine thoſe that be old Captaines, practiſed, and bearing a good port, and that be loued and deſired of the ſoldiers, whom he ought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companie and prefer with the greateſt authoritie he can giue, with ample, ſealed, and autentike Patents, thereby more ſpeedily and more eaſily he may accompliſh his affaires.</p>
               <p>It is requiſite he equally impart to euery one, the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of that preſt money he hath receiued, to the intent the Captaine and the officers ariſe not to be burdened, taxed, and conſumed by ordinarie and extraordinarie meanes, and other manifeſt wayes about thoſe affaires; and to the intent the ſoldiers may taſte of beneuolence of their Colonell: for by that meanes credit is ſuſtained, and his traine augmented, a thing moſt neceſſarie to perſonages that ſupply ſo great a place. For it is requiſite that men in the beginning be not diſcouraged for want of neceſſary
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:181245:69"/> prouiſion, yea rather to lend of his owne (conſidering he is to be paid againe) then his ſouldiers ſhould bee brought to any extremity.</p>
               <p>The diſtribution of the preſt-money ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred with great prudence, for afterwards at the banke, the ſame otherwiſe may be retained, and ſubſtraction made of all the whole money, either in the firſt pay or thoſe that follow, more or leſſe as it ſeemes expedient, principally for the vſe and commoditie of the ſouldiers, conſidering (that according to the Prouerb) a man can hardly at any time ſerue two maſters, and therefore hee muſt ſtand vpon this ſpeciall point, to be more carefull not to doe any thing preiudiciall to the honourable exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of armes, then to pleaſe the couetous and inſatiable humour of ſome Captaines, whom in effect it pleaſures but little, in reſpect their greedy deſire is neuer ſatisfied: Neuertheleſſe it falls out to bee a maruellous loſſe and hinderance to the enterpriſe, ſpecially to men of valour and ſouldiers, without whoſe aide a Collonell is but of ſmall force and value: And to conclude, money muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies be procured, diſperſed and ſpent with great diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, order, and conſideration, ſince the ſame is ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to man, as it is called the ſinewes of warres.</p>
               <p>It is a thing moſt requiſite that he carrie with him at the leaſt, one Miniſter, a man of good life, who may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarly attend about the care of Eccleſiaſticall matters, wherein aboue all other things we ought thorowly to be ſtaid and inſtructed.</p>
               <p>He muſt likewiſe haue in his regiment beſides the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Surgeons, an excellent and tried Phiſition, well prouided of all drugs and ſpiceries, and of other things neceſſarie to be miniſtred to thoſe that be ſicke.</p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:181245:69"/>
               <p>His Lieutenant for his regiment muſt be of a ſingular qualitie and excellent experience, who not onely muſt particularly gouerne his owne band and company, but alſo with great prudence and policie take care and charge ouer all the people which are in the bands vnder his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell, wherein the Lieutenant muſt proceed according to my rules for the Lieutenant of a priuate band, and the notes in my ſecond and third booke. His owne Alfierus as Generall and Superiour to the reſt of the Enſigne-bearers vnder his Collonnelſhip, muſt bee guided and gouerned by a ſingular and ſubſtantiall ſouldier, a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of an auncient houſe, courteous, wiſe and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with good conditions.</p>
               <p>The ſame order he ought likewiſe to obſerue, in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of his Caualliers of the ſquadre, of his Sergeants, of his Corporalls, of his Drummers, and euery other Officer. It is a thing moſt neceſſary and conuenient, as in my ſecond booke, and the office of a Captaine I haue touched, that a Collonell ſhould retaine in his regiment, and ſpecially in his owne band about him, a number of wiſe and worthy ſouldiers, to be the Gentlemen of his company, Lance Spezzate, or ſerue for extraordinarie Lieutenants, whom the Collonell muſt not onely vſe and entreat well with an aduantage in their pay, but alſo feaſt them, cheriſh them, and ſet them oftentimes by courſe at his owne table, and alwaies ſhew them a courteous coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, with which ſhew of friendly courteſie, ſouldiers be incredibly fedde, and contrariwiſe maruellouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with the hautie lookes of proud diſdaine. For all thoſe that make profeſſion of this worthy Art, are of great curioſitie and courage, and therefore men of warre ought neuer (againſt right) be villanouſly handled, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:181245:70"/> in word, deed or countenance.</p>
               <p>He muſt create a Sergeant Maior, that is a ſouldier of great experience, and that particularly is a profeſſour of that office, to the end he know preciſely what is to bee preferred in euery practiſe: ſuch a one as can yeeld there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a perfect account and diſcourſe, and that conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can much better by deed then by word execute any enterpriſe. And for that in his office it is neceſſarie for him to vary and change purpoſe, with infinite aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and conſiderations, as the ſhortneſſe of time now and then requires, the diſcommoditie of the place and ſeat thereof doth inforce, the order of the enemies doth conſtraine, or according to his owne proper pollicie, or the prouident prudence of his Collonell: but for that this place doth not permit to ſpeake particularly of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry point, I will paſſe ouer the ſame, and onely referre all to the prouidence of his long and approued experience, which of neceſſitie is required vnto him, which I further referre to my following diſcourſe of the Sergeant Maior generall.</p>
               <p>He ought to make a Marſhall of his lodgings, who muſt be his principall Furrier and Harbinger, that muſt attend with great diligence, to procure lodging for all, without pleaſing any one particular perſon for any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate commoditie whatſoeuer, but muſt equally diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, and depart the quarters and lodgings according as neede requires: neither is it to be borne withall, that hee doe make free any houſes or lodgings, neither go about any ſuch like gaine, a moſt diſhoneſt and vnlawfull rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berie, which oftentimes doth cauſe great loſſe &amp; diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie to men of warre, ſmall reputation to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductour, and great vexation and diſturbance to the poore
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:181245:70"/> people, who for the moſt part are innocent. The Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels Harbinger hauing allotted out lodgings to euery band he muſt prefer the particular diſtribution to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Harbingers.</p>
               <p>A generall Drummer ought likewiſe to be created and appointed, who may take charge and care ouer all the reſt of the Drummers, whoſe office and cuſtome amongſt them is to conſerue and keepe orders, to the intent they may be obeyed, and that euery one performe his dutie appertaining to his office, as to ſtrike the batterie in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching in battaile, or diſſeuered, to make generall bands and cries, in the morning, in the euening at the cloſing of the night, and in ſounding the march, the call, the charge, the battell, the retrait, with ſuch other like obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations and neceſſarie things to be done.</p>
               <p>He muſt procure to haue part of euery munition for his regiment, out of the principall and generall munition, as corſlets, pikes, halberds, hargabuſes with their furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, match, lead, pouder, of all ſort of victuall, and each thing elſe as occaſion and neceſſitie requires, which hee muſt cauſe his Sergeant maior to diſtribute amongſt his bands, that his ſouldiers be not exacted on the priſe. The like diuiſion he muſt cauſe him to make by money it ſelfe, but neuer more then that which reſts as due to them, as many very maliciouſly haue accuſtomed to doe, making merchandiſe thereof to the loſſe and ruine of their ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: towards whom they are bound continually to procure manifeſt commoditie and profit. The like is to be obſerued in all other things neceſſarie and comform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to this before ſaid, without ſelling of furniture to them of exceſſiue priſe, for nothing is more diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or more miſerable, then to extort vpon ſouldiers.</p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:181245:71"/>
               <p>It is very requiſite that hee examine the election<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and choiſe, that euery Captaine hath made of his Officers in euery band, and whether they doe thorowly poſſeſſe or approach very neere to the perfit experience they ought to doe, of whom and not otherwiſe he ſhall like and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Note that theſe aduertiſements, make manifeſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parence, and ſets forth to the view of the world, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward valour of the Conductour and Collonell: for if he neglect theſe obſeruations, the contrarie doth eaſily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue. I iudge it a thing not out of ſquare, but rather moſt expedient that the one halfe of the Caualliers of the choiſe ſquadre ſhould be Hargabuſiers on horſe-backe, ſpecially when warres be made in large and open coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, or elſe howſoeuer it be ſituate: for being men of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, they may both on horſbacke and foote doe great ſeruice, as often hath beene tried by manifeſt experience in our time, ſpecially in the late warres of <hi>Flaunders,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my Collonell the Baron of <hi>Sheueran,</hi> in ſeruice of <hi>Don Iohn</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> where I being of the number of the Gentlemen of his owne band, haue ſeene daily excellent good ſeruice done by them, as well by diſcouering the enemies ambuſcades, as to draw them into the danger of our footemen. And likewiſe in the ſpeedy taking and keeping a paſſage of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, in winning aduertiſements and the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word from the enemy, in taking Priſoners, in breaking the way for free paſſage, in clearing and beating the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, and ſcouring them free from the enemie and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>booters, in making roades, courſes and incurſions, in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering the Countrey and taking view thereof like to light horſemen, ſpecially in the abſence of the Cauallery of the campe. And therefore I conclude that they ſhall
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:181245:71"/> be found to be a knot and kinde of neceſſary ſouldiers, prouided that they be practiſed, and aboue all full of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and aſpiring mindes, and not to be common ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, taken at vnawares out of ordinary bands of foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, neither ſuch as carry a dull, baſe and abiect minde or diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>If the Colonell had the authority to be able to keepe together a band with a Standerd or Guidon, &amp; a trumpet to them, they would doe ſingular good ſeruice, which neuertheleſſe when ſeruice on foote did call them forth, might deliuer vp their horſes, lances, and hargabuſhes with fire-lockes vnto their ſeruants, kept and maintained for that purpoſe, and enter into ranke or battaile amongſt the reſt of the Caualliers ſquadre, and ſo ſhould the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie and common cuſtome of hauing horſes amongſt priuate ſouldiers be auoided, ſaue ſuch as are permitted and granted to ſome Officers, as in my former diſcourſes I haue already declared. The which obſeruation ſhall bring to paſſe that the ſouldiers in marching and in other enterpriſes ſhall go together, and be vnited about the Enſigne, which is a thing moſt conuenient and neceſſarie, and ought greatly to be ſhunned, for that horſes by ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart trauerſing are accuſtomed to deface the ſquares, and breake the rankes of the footmens battailes, which truely is very odious and of great diſturbance and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodity: but that which I ſpeake of this extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie band is to be vnderſtood and taken, when there is no ordinarie bands of horſemen ioyned to a Collonells re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment. He ought to take vigilant care that the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of his band and Caualliers of his ſquadre, being continually about his perſon doe diligently performe, that which they are appointed of him to doe by commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:181245:72"/> or otherwiſe, and that they make faithfull and true relation to him of euery particular thing, that he may be euer fully informed of all things, and chiefly of that which doth paſſe in the watch worthy and neceſſary to be noted, as well by day as by night, ſince that by going the round, which doth appertaine principally to theſe Caualliers, many things of moment and importance may very well be obſerued, being able to execute any of the inferiour offices, and both quickly conceiue and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly vtter any new accident.</p>
               <p>The Collonell muſt moſt carefully with humble cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie court his Captaine generall, vſe great reſpect to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, obey him, and giue him faithfull counſell: and to the end he may performe this thorow well, hee muſt neuer refuſe toile or trauell, ſince that to take paine about matters of like importance, is agreeable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient to honourable perſonages his equals, whereas eaſie delicacie and curioſitie appertaines to women, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther effeminate perſons, who eſteeme more of belly-cheere, gallant attire and riches, then of the peereleſſe priſe of valour and vertue, and that prefer a fraile body before an immortall ſoule.</p>
               <p>Some hold opinion that a Collonell hauing to allot out what number of pikes, ſhort weapons, and ſhot is to be in euery band, that it is farre better to haue but one ſort of weapons, ſo ſhall the Captaine euer accompany his own ſouldiers, whereas otherwiſe they being diſſeuered in a ſtand-battaile, he muſt either loſe the company of his ſhot or pikes, the one of them being committed to a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and the ſhort weapons to a Third, which doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much encourage the Souldier, as to ſee his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine companion of his perils, and the contrarie no leſſe
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:181245:72"/> diſmaieth him: but for that foughten fields chance ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in our time, I ceaſe to wade further therein, onely aduertiſing that amongſt the reſt of his ſouldiers, the armed pikes muſt be gently vſed, ſhewing them a cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and good countenance, who muſt bee choſen men, very hardy and valiant.</p>
               <p>He muſt procure that his Officers diligently performe his commiſſions, and that faithfully they make relation of euery particular thing, that he may be enformed of all, and eſpecially that which happens inwards, as well in the day as in the night, for they going in circuit, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaines vnto them, may well perceiue what chanceth of any great importance. So that by obſeruing theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſements, the induſtrie of the Leader doth appeare, whereas not being well looked vnto great ruine doth ariſe.</p>
               <p>To conclude, when his regiment is diſcharged, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the end of the warres or otherwiſe, hee ought to take care that he in any wiſe procure, that they may bee conducted wholy together, and afterwards diſband them in ſuch a place, as from thence euery ſouldier may eaſily and without feare tranſport himſelfe into his owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and if it be poſſible, hauing his health, his armes, and his apparell entire: for otherwiſe if ſouldiers be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuered in far countries, they ſuffer great inconuenience, in hard and difficile paſſages, in victuals and lodgings, the which doth cauſe their deſtruction, the diſcredite and diſhonour of their Conductour, and is a great blot in the fame of our nation, as thoſe that haue ſeene <hi>Holland</hi> and the <hi>Low-countries</hi> can witnes: wherfore it is a thing to be reformed for the increaſe of our credite and old naturall valour.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> A Rule to ſet Souldiers in aray.</head>
               <p>THe Footmen being aſſembled at the place where they are to be ſet in aray: Firſt, you muſt foreſee, that the ground be fit and capable for the purpoſe, that the aray may commodiouſly turne to the right or left hand, as much as may be neuertheleſſe, according to the number of ſoldiers you haue, you are to proceed in this ſort as followeth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, to wit that all the ſoldiers of a band of foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are bound by the law of Armes, forthwith and as ſoone as they ſhall heare the Drum beat a Call to repaire to the Colours, vnder paine &amp;c. except that ſicknes be the cauſe thereof; or that hauing a licence or forelofe they may thereby excuſe themſelues. But to returne: you are to begin in this order following: Firſt, you are to draw the pikes by themſelues on the one ſide, togither with the Enſigne: and vpon the other ſide all the muske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, ſomewhat aloofe diſtant from the pikes, beginning to make the musketiers march ſo many in a ranke as you liſt, parting them neuertheleſſe according to their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: you may put them from 3 to 12 in a ranke; for it is not often ſeene that more than 11 is put in a ranke, how great ſoeuer the number of the footmen be: neither in troth ought they to be any more than 11 in a ranke: for when they paſſe 11 or 12 they are not to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an array, but rather a battaile: I haue omitted to write herein of the placing of my officers belonging to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of footmen, you ſhall finde it plainely ſet downe in the march, and at the beginning of the exerciſe of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:181245:75"/> training: ſo to returne, hauing then placed the number of musketiers you ſhall thinke good of to be in a ranke, you ſhall cauſe them to march in good proportion, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding forth one ranke after an other; the Sargeant ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill on the one ſide, cauſing them to paſſe before him, iudging by the eye-ſight from Ranke to Ranke of all the ſoldiers, one by one, whether they be right in line, obſeruing true diſtance: and alſo that they carry their Armes in warlike order; for this is the beauty of an aray. Moreouer the Sargeant hauing ſpeciall reſpect to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate and place at the head of the array, the Gentlemen of the company, and alſo the Corporals which carry muskets; placing next vnto them the beſt men, and the beſt furniſhed ſoldiers; and placing alſo at the Reare of the battell your beſt men, and the reſt of your beſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; to the intent the aray may ſhew the better: foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as when they are diuided into aray, the musketiers from the pikemen, and that they turne their faces; then the backe part or Reare is made the front: therefore the Reare ought to be as well furniſhed as the front, as I haue ſaid before in the dutie of a Sargeant: the which if you deſire to doe, it is neceſſarie you put in the midſt of the Rankes the weakeſt and worſt furniſhed; aduertiſing the Sargeant that the ſoldiers are beſt furniſhed, when they haue all ſorts of Armes and furniture that be neceſſarie for them: and there appertaines to a musketier good match, fire-cole, powder and bullet, and moreouer <hi>l'aſsine.</hi> And this is to be obſerued with all ſpeed and diligence that the time or occaſion doth carry, and the ſuſpition of the enemy doth import.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:181245:75"/>
                  <head>Here next is demonſtrated the diſtance obſerued betwixt Ranke and Ranke, man and man, both in marching, and alſo in maine battaile.</head>
                  <p>FIrſt both pikes and muskets are to be ordered into files of 10 deepe, the musketiers in marching are ſometimes placed in the front, ſometimes in the front and ſometimes in the Reare of the pikes, but moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly being in ſingle aray they are to march both in the Front and Reare: In maine battell the ſoldiers are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſometimes in the right flanke, ſometimes in both the flankes; and ſometimes it will be commanded that they be brought in the Front of the battaile, and alſo in the Reare.</p>
                  <p>In exerciſing the motions there are two diſtances to be kept.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is when euery one is diſtant from his fellow 6 foote ſquare; that is, in File and Ranke 6 foote.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is when euery ſoldier is 3 foote diſtant one from another, as well in File as in Ranke: And in reſpect the meaſure of ſuch diſtances cannot alwaies be taken euenly by the racke of the eye; the diſtance of 6 foote betweene the files is meaſured, when the ſoldiers ſtretching out their armes, doe touch one anothers hands: and betwixt the Rankes, when that the ends of their pikes come very neere to the hams of them that march before them: And the diſtance of 3 foot betwixt the Files is when their elbowes touch one another: and betwixt their Rankes when they come to touch the ends of one anothers Rapiers or ſwords. In marching in the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:181245:76"/> field the diſtance of 3 foote from File to File is kept, and of 6 foote from Ranke to Ranke, when the ſoldiers order themſelues in battell; and alſo when they march towards the enemie, the diſtance of 3 foote both in File and Ranke is to be obſerued. And likewiſe in conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or wheeling. The musketiers making ready to ſhoote by rankes keepe the ſame diſtance of 3 foote, but going to skirmiſh they goe <hi>a la diſabande,</hi> that is, out of order.</p>
                  <p>There is alſo vſed another order of diſtance; which is ſeldome obſerued but for to receiue the enemie with a firme ſtand, and ſerueth for the pikes onely: for the musketiers cannot ſtand ſo cloſe in files, becauſe they muſt haue their armes at liberty, and that is, when euery diſtance from file to file is a foote and a halfe, and 3 foote from Ranke to Ranke: and this laſt diſtance is thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: <hi>Cloſe your ſelues throughly.</hi> But it is not to be taught the ſoldiers: for that when neceſſitie ſhall require it, they will cloſe themſelues too much of their owne accord without command.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>How Pikes are to be raiſed vp and abaſed in cloſing and opening of a battaile.</head>
                  <p>I Will not omit to put in memorie vnto them that know not of the particulars of thoſe things and order that are required in making a battell of footmen. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe which would make a battell of footmen, muſt be aduertiſed that in ſhutting vp the ſaid battell, the ranks of pikes as well armed as vnarmed, muſt not raiſe vp confuſedly, but with order; that is, when the Sargeant maior, Captaine, or Lieutenant ſhall ſay:
<q>
                        <pb n="141" facs="tcp:181245:76"/>Raiſe or right vp your Pikes,</q> then it is requiſite that the firſt and formoſt Ranke muſt begin to raiſe vp it ſelfe: and that the ſecond doe not moue to raiſe vp it ſelfe till the firſt be raiſed vp: and ſo the third and fourth: the ſame order is to be obſerued in all the other Rankes, from one Ranke to an other.</p>
                  <p>The like Rule is to be obſerued by them in laying downe of their pikes vpon their ſhoulders: for ſo much as Ranke by Ranke, in order and without confuſion they ought to let fall their pikes; appointing the firſt Ranke to fall after the ſecond, the third after the fourth: and ſo is all the reſt of the Rankes to follow the ſame order, till the hindermoſt Ranke of all: And by obſeruing that order, they cannot commit diſorder, but rather make a gallant ſhew, and preuent many confuſions.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>How Pikes are to be carried in aray, march, or battell, with alſo other neceſſarie notes.</head>
                  <p>THoſe that are appointed to carry pikes in array of Rankes or battell, muſt know that pikes amongſt all other weapons that belong to ſoldiers is of greateſt honor and credit: And truely whoſoeuer doth carry and manage the ſame weapon well, and with good grace, doth make a very beautifull and pleaſant ſhew to the beholders; and chiefly when it is caried with a good grace, as I haue ſaid before, and with <hi>il combedo alto.</hi> And as touching the obſeruation of ſhouldring of pikes, to wit, that there is a new order obſerued in the Low Countries now of late; the Commanders there will haue the pikes to be carried vpon the right ſhoulder, and not to remoue or change to the left ſhoulder at all.</p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:181245:77"/>
                  <p>Note alſo that the Pike-man doe march then with a good grace holding vp his head gallantly: his pace full of grauitie and eſtate, and ſuch as is fit for his perſon: And let his body be ſtraight and as much vpright as is poſſible: And that which moſt imports is that they haue alwaies their eyes vpon their companions which are in ranke with them; and before them: going iuſt one with the other: and keeping perfit diſtance without commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting error in the leaſt pace or ſtep: and euery pace and motion with one accord and conſent; they ought to make at one inſtant time: And in this ſort all the rankes intirely are to march ſometimes ſoftly ſometimes faſt according to the ſtrokes of the drumme: the heele and the tippe of their pikes would be equally holden: both of length and height as neere as is poſſible: to auoid that they fall not out to be ſeeme by bearing them otherwiſe like vnto Organ-pipes ſome long ſome ſhort. The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and propertie thereof: to hold the heele of the pike is this; it is neceſſarie for him to haue an eie to the ranke that doth march before him: and ſo carrie the Butt-end or heele of his pike that it may be iuſt ouer againſt the ioynt of the hamme of the ſouldier that in march ſhall be ſtraight before him: And ſo euery one from hand to hand muſt obſerue the proportion of that height: And that is, right behind vpon the ioynt of the knee: for by doing ſo they cannot commit errour; carying in their march that legge that is vnder that arme that ſuſtaines and caries the Pike of iuſt and euen proportion: by mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their pace right-vnder the ſtaffe of the pike: going in their march as I haue ſaid before: iuſt and euen with a ſtately and ſumptuous pace, for by doing ſo they ſhall be eſteemed, honoured and commended of all the Lookers
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:181245:77"/> on, and they will take wonderfull delight to behold them march in that order: And whereas I haue ſaid before that the Souldiers ſhould march forward with one conſent: I meane not onely that the Pike men ought to obſerue that order: but alſo that the musketeares are to follow the ſame rule of order: becauſe that the whole company muſt be ready to march forward at one inſtant time ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing the true ſtrokes or battery of the drumme, which actiue obſeruation may well be compared to a Dancer; for the one by hearing his muſicke is prepared to tread the meaſure anſwerable to the time: And the other by hearing the warlike and comfortable ſtroke of the drum: is ready to aduance his pace and march forward.</p>
                  <p>The Officer is to pace towards his people, ſo to giue the word, and ſo to lead march, and alſo obſeruing the ſtrokes of the drum, the firſt ranke being the file leaders it to follow their Leader: The ſecond ranke euery one to follow his pile-leader alſo: The third, fourth and fift rankes; and ſo the reſt with one conſent.</p>
                  <p>I hold it therefore both conuenient and needfull for all men that follow the warres, to learne all the warlike ſounds that the Drummer beates, as the call, the march, to draw vp maine-battell, the charge, the retire, to troupe, to wheele about which is alſo a charge, then and laſtly the diana. And whereas euery nation doe differ the one from the other in the batterie of their drummes, and chiefly in the ſound of their march euery nation or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince doe alſo differ in the marke of their colours, for that they beare in their colours the proper Armes or Scutchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Nation vnder which they doe ſerue. But to returne, let a ſouldier be diligent to learne, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the ſtrokes of the drumme: And chiefly to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:181245:78"/> the vſuall ſtrokes of march which the drumme beat in the regiment wherein he beareth armes: he muſt alſo take notice of the markes that are vpon the colours; eſpecially of the Enſigne which hee ſerueth vnder, the knowledge whereof may ſerue his turne ſo well that it may ſaue his life, for by night being in fight with the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and being alſo ignorant of the ſound of drumme, he may aſwell fall into the hands of his enemies as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, which may coſt him his life: Then as touching his Enſigne the ſouldier being ſcattered from his company in marching, or otherwiſe in fight, and if it be by day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light he may perceiue his owne colours farre off. To wit, that both drummes and fifes were firſt inuented by the <hi>Switzers,</hi> wherewith they will euen liue and die in all manner of fight. The <hi>Almaines</hi> alſo inuented a pipe which is called by them <hi>Schalmeyen.</hi> Some nations when they doe fight a pitched field by reaſon of the tumult, and rumour that will grow amongſt the ſouldiers, they haue trumpets to giue the charge, which yeeldeth great comfort to the ſouldiers in regard that they heare the eccho and ſound of the trumpets ſo plaine, that in all diſtreſſe they doe not onely keep together, but alſo know their charge. Therefore in forraine Countries the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are as well acquainted in all points of warre which the ſaid trumpets doe vſe to ſound that they know their charge euen as well as horſemen doe. But to returne to the matter aforeſaid: the <hi>Turke</hi> when he doth either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the charge giuen him by his enemies, or when he will giue a charge &amp;c. it will bee commanded that a Drummer ſhall ride from ranke to ranke to giue the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers notice by a ſoft ſound: And as touching marching, it is to be vnderſtood that ſome kinde of march is a right
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:181245:78"/> induction; other ſome a deduction on the right or left hand; and that in ſingle, double, treble, or quadruple ſided battell: in a ſingle when one enemie is feared; in a double when two; in a treble when three; and in a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druble when the enemie purpoſeth to inuade on all ſides: Therefore the march is vndertaken ſometimes in a ſingle challenge, and ſometimes in a twofold challenge, or elſe in a threefold challenge, or in a fourefold challenge. The ſouldiers, both Pikemen and Musketeares are to be diuided into companies, and euery company is to conſiſt halfe of pikes, and halfe of musketeares.</p>
                  <p>The companies happen and fall out ſometimes to be more in number, and ſometimes leſſe; ſome extend to 100. men, ſome 200. ſome 300. ſome 400. and ſo forth till 800 men or more. Euery company ought to haue theſe Officers following: a Captaine, a Lieutenant, an Enſigne, two Sergeants, three Corporalls, two Drums; but by the opinion of many worthy ſouldiers, euery hundreth men ought to haue a Drumme; the reaſon whereof I omit to ſpeake thereof in this place, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the matter: it will be needfull for a Captaine to haue in his company for neceſſarie vſes a Clarke, a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, and a Prouoſt. Companies are drawne into Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the Regiments are euer to be commanded by Coronells: Regiments doe ſometimes likewiſe differ in the number of companies, ſome conſiſt of 6. ſome of 7. ſome of 8. or 10. ſome 15. &amp;c. In the ordering, and managing of euery regiment is to be required a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronell &amp;c.</p>
